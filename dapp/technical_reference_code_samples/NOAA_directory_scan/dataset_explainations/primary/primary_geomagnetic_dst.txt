The JSON file you uploaded contains geomagnetic Dst index data from NOAA. The Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) index is a measure of geomagnetic activity, primarily used to assess the intensity of geomagnetic storms caused by solar wind interactions with Earth’s magnetosphere.

Breakdown of the JSON Fields:
	1.	time_tag – The timestamp of the measurement in UTC.
	2.	dst – The Dst index value in nanoteslas (nT), indicating geomagnetic disturbance levels.

Purpose of the Data:
	•	Geomagnetic Storm Monitoring: The Dst index helps track geomagnetic storms triggered by solar activity, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares.
	•	Space Weather Forecasting: Scientists and space agencies use Dst to predict space weather conditions affecting satellite operations, GPS accuracy, and electrical grids.
	•	Magnetospheric Science: Used in research to study the behavior of Earth’s magnetosphere during solar storms.

Understanding the Dst Index:
	•	Negative Dst values indicate stronger geomagnetic disturbances.
	•	More negative values (below -50 nT) typically correspond to geomagnetic storm conditions.
	•	Extreme storms can push Dst below -200 nT, signaling potential risks to satellites, power grids, and communication systems.
