The JSON file you uploaded from NOAA appears to contain primary cosmic ray data from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) or a similar monitoring system. This data likely originates from NOAA’s GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites), which monitor cosmic radiation levels in Earth’s near-space environment.

Breakdown of the JSON Fields:
	1.	time_tag – The timestamp indicating when the measurement was recorded in UTC.
	2.	dsflag_p10 & dsflag_p30 – Flags related to data status or quality assurance for the respective energy levels.
	3.	p_gt_10 – The flux (particles per unit time and area) of cosmic rays greater than 10 MeV (Mega electron Volts).
	4.	p_gt_30 – The flux of cosmic rays greater than 30 MeV.

Purpose of This Data:
	•	Space Weather Monitoring: Helps track space weather events, such as solar storms and geomagnetic disturbances.
	•	Radiation Hazard Analysis: Used for assessing potential radiation exposure risks to astronauts, satellites, and high-altitude aviation.
	•	Solar Activity & Cosmic Ray Studies: Used by scientists to study cosmic ray variations and solar energetic particles (SEPs).

How It’s Used:
	•	Forecasting Solar Storms: Sudden increases in these values might indicate incoming solar energetic particle events (solar flares or coronal mass ejections).
	•	Satellite & GPS System Protection: High radiation levels can cause malfunctions or damage.
	•	Aviation & Astronaut Safety: Pilots and astronauts need to be aware of cosmic radiation exposure risks.
