The JSON file secondary_plasma_pressure.json contains solar wind plasma data, which is critical for understanding space weather and its effects on Earthâ€™s magnetosphere. This dataset tracks key properties of the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun.

Breakdown of Key Fields:
	1.	time_tag â€“ The timestamp (UTC) of the measurement.
	2.	dsflag â€“ A data status flag, indicating the quality of the data (values like 0, 1, 6, etc.).
	3.	dens â€“ Plasma density (particles per cubic centimeter), which indicates the number of charged particles in the solar wind.
	4.	speed â€“ Solar wind speed (kilometers per second), showing how fast the charged particles are moving.
	5.	temperature â€“ Plasma temperature (Kelvin), which provides insight into the energy level of the solar wind particles.

Purpose of This Data:
	â€¢	Space Weather Monitoring: Helps predict the effects of solar storms, including geomagnetic disturbances.
	â€¢	Geomagnetic Storm Forecasting: Variations in solar wind density, speed, and temperature can indicate an incoming coronal mass ejection (CME) or high-speed solar wind streams.
	â€¢	Satellite Protection: Sudden spikes in solar wind speed and density can damage satellites, disrupt communications, and cause GPS errors.
	â€¢	Aurora Prediction: Increased solar wind activity leads to stronger auroras, which can be seen at lower latitudes.
	â€¢	Power Grid Protection: High plasma pressure can induce geomagnetically induced currents (GICs), potentially causing power grid disruptions.

Understanding Solar Wind Plasma Properties:

Parameter	Normal Range	High Impact Levels	Effects
Density (particles/cmÂ³)	1 - 10	> 20	Can indicate a CME shock wave
Speed (km/s)	300 - 500	> 700	High-speed streams from coronal holes
Temperature (K)	10,000 - 100,000	> 500,000	Sign of increased solar wind energy

Recent Data Observations:

2025-02-23 00:00	2.47	300.3	23,768
2025-02-22 22:00	2.89	303.0	26,256
2025-02-22 19:00	3.23	302.5	34,400
2025-02-22 17:00	2.40	313.1	59,342
2025-02-22 12:00	0.82	295.6	41,104

ðŸ”¹ Current observations suggest stable solar wind conditions, with plasma speeds around 300-320 km/s, indicating low geomagnetic storm activity.
ðŸ”¸ Temperature spikes (e.g., 115,544 K on Feb 22 01:00 UTC) may indicate a minor solar event.
