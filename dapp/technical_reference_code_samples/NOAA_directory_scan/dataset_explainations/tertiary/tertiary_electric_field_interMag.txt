The JSON file tertiary_electric_field_interMag.json contains electric field measurements derived from the InterMag EarthScope project, which monitors variations in Earth’s geomagnetic field. This data is critical for understanding geomagnetic disturbances, ionospheric dynamics, and space weather effects.

Key Fields in the JSON
	1.	time_tag – Timestamp of the recorded measurement (e.g., “2025-02-23”).
	2.	cadence – Time interval between measurements (e.g., 60 seconds).
	3.	product_version – Specifies the dataset version (“InterMagEarthScope”).
	4.	type – Defines the dataset as a “FeatureCollection.”
	5.	features – Contains multiple measurement points with:
	•	geometry: Latitude & longitude coordinates of the measurement site.
	•	properties:
	•	Ex – Electric field strength in the east-west direction (V/m).
	•	Ey – Electric field strength in the north-south direction (V/m).
	•	quality_flag – Data reliability indicator.
	•	distance_nearest_station – Distance from the nearest monitoring station.

Purpose of This Data
	•	Monitoring Geomagnetic Storms
	•	Helps detect electric field fluctuations due to solar activity and geomagnetic disturbances.
	•	Studying Earth’s Ionosphere
	•	Determines how charged particles interact with the atmosphere, affecting radio communications and GPS accuracy.
	•	Understanding Ground-Induced Currents (GICs)
	•	Detects variations in the Earth’s electric field, which can induce currents in power grids and cause transformer failures.
	•	Space Weather Analysis
	•	Helps track solar storms, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and their impact on Earth’s magnetosphere.

Key Observations from Recent Data

Latitude	Longitude	Ex (V/m)	Ey (V/m)	Distance to Station (km)
41.0°N	-124.0°W	-1.35	-18.32	570.49 km
42.0°N	-124.0°W	-0.57	-7.73	657.64 km
43.0°N	-124.0°W	3.03	-3.94	615.44 km
44.0°N	-124.0°W	0.57	-1.59	504.57 km
45.0°N	-124.0°W	0.20	-0.77	393.89 km

🔹 Negative Ex and Ey values indicate strong electric field variations, which could be caused by geomagnetic disturbances.
🔸 Higher values (>10 V/m) in the Ey direction suggest stronger north-south electrical currents, possibly indicating a geomagnetic storm in progress.

Applications of This Data
	•	NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC): Issues alerts for geomagnetic storms and electric grid impacts.
	•	Electric Utility Companies: Uses data to mitigate power outages from ground-induced currents (GICs).
	•	NASA & Satellite Operations: Helps protect satellites from charged particle disturbances.
	•	Geophysics Research & Climate Studies: Tracks long-term trends in Earth’s electromagnetic environment.
