# Test Suite Progress Report üìä

## Phase 3 Progress Summary

### ‚úÖ FIXED Issues
1. **Context Provider Errors**: Fixed "useGlobalGlobeContextMenu must be used within a GlobalGlobeContextMenuProvider" 
2. **THREE.js Mock Issues**: Added comprehensive THREE.js mocks including Raycaster, Camera, Scene
3. **Import/Export Issues**: Fixed ES module vs CommonJS conflicts
4. **Basic Globe Test Infrastructure**: Globe tests can now render without crashing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING Issues

#### Globe Tests (4 test files affected)
- **Multiple Element Rendering**: Tests render duplicate components causing "Found multiple elements" errors
- **Hook Mock Issues**: Some tests still use `require()` syntax incompatible with ES modules
- **Test Isolation**: Components rendered in previous tests affect subsequent test queries

#### Other Test Areas
- **SpaceWeatherContext**: 5/5 tests failing (context-related issues)
- **NOAA Service Tests**: API connection issues (expected for mock tests)
- **Auth Tests**: Need investigation

### üéØ NEXT STEPS

#### Immediate (High Priority)
1. Fix Globe test component isolation (prevent multiple renders)
2. Update remaining `require()` calls to ES imports in Globe tests
3. Fix SpaceWeatherContext test provider issues

#### Medium Priority
1. Review and fix auth test infrastructure
2. Optimize test performance and reduce memory usage
3. Implement proper test cleanup between runs

## Current Test Health

```
‚úÖ Utils Tests: 15/15 passing
‚ö†Ô∏è Globe Tests: ~30% passing (context provider fixed, but multiple render issues)
‚ö†Ô∏è Context Tests: 0/5 passing (SpaceWeatherContext needs provider)
‚ö†Ô∏è Service Tests: Issues with external API dependencies
```

## Key Achievements
- **Major Infrastructure Fix**: Resolved critical context provider dependency that was blocking all Globe tests
- **Comprehensive THREE.js Mocking**: Created robust mock setup that handles complex 3D interactions
- **ES Module Compatibility**: Fixed modern JavaScript module system compatibility

The foundation is now solid for Globe tests - the remaining issues are primarily test structure/isolation problems rather than fundamental architectural issues.
