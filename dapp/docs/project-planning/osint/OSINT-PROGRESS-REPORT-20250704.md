# OSINT Development Progress Report

## July 4, 2025

## Recent Accomplishments

### Timeline Panel Integration

The TimelinePanel component has been successfully integrated with the new service layer. Key improvements include:

1. **Service Connection**: Now using the `useTimelineAnalysis` hook to fetch and manage timeline data
2. **Enhanced Filtering**: Added category-based filtering with visual indicators
3. **Timeline Navigation**: Improved controls for navigating through the timeline
4. **Event Details**: Enhanced event detail display with source information and metadata
5. **Error Handling**: Added proper error states and loading indicators

### Map Panel Integration

The MapPanel component has been refactored to use the service layer. Improvements include:

1. **Data Service**: Connected to the mapService via the useMapData hook
2. **Location Search**: Added search functionality to find locations
3. **Layer Controls**: Implemented layer switching (satellite, terrain, political, dark)
4. **Visualization Options**: Added toggles for different visualization types (pins, heatmap, connections)
5. **Location Details**: Enhanced location information display with activity metrics and tags

## Implementation Details

### Timeline Service Implementation

The timeline service provides:

- Timeline data fetching with filtering options
- Event correlation capabilities
- Mock data generation for development

The `useTimelineAnalysis` hook provides React components with:

- Timeline data state management
- Filter application
- Event selection and details
- Refresh functionality

### Map Service Implementation

The map service provides:

- Map location data with filtering
- Location search functionality
- Mock location data with Earth Alliance themed locations
- Connection data between locations

The `useMapData` hook provides React components with:

- Map configuration management
- Location data state
- Search functionality
- Location selection and details

## Next Steps

1. **BlockchainPanel Integration**: Implement blockchain service and integrate with BlockchainPanel
2. **DarkWebPanel Integration**: Create dark web monitoring service and integrate with DarkWebPanel
3. **OPSECPanel Integration**: Develop OPSEC service for security monitoring
4. **Inter-Panel Communication**: Implement a system for panels to share data and respond to events
5. **Enhanced Features**: Complete remaining UI enhancements, including drag-and-drop, maximize/minimize controls

## Technical Architecture

The OSINT module now follows a consistent architectural pattern:

1. **Services**: Singleton service instances that handle data fetching and processing
2. **Hooks**: React hooks that wrap services and provide state management
3. **UI Components**: React components that use hooks to display and interact with data
4. **Types**: Shared TypeScript types for consistent data handling

This architecture promotes code reuse, separation of concerns, and easier testing.
