## 3. Technical Debt & Improvements

### 3.1 Current Issues

- TypeScript Errors: Some type definitions need refinement
- Duplicate Investigation interfaces need consolidation
- Command palette execution needs proper implementation of all commands
- Missing unit and integration tests
- Limited error handling in UI components

### 3.2 Code Quality Improvements

- Add comprehensive unit tests for all components
- Create integration tests for panel interactions
- Document all exported functions and components
- Refactor any duplicated logic into shared utilities
- Create proper error boundaries for component failures

## 4. Development Approach

### 4.1 Phase-based Approach

Continue with the phased development approach outlined in the implementation plan:

1. Complete Core Infrastructure
2. Implement Basic Features with real data
3. Add Advanced Capabilities
4. Integrate Premium Features

### 4.2 Development Practices

- Follow artifact-driven development with clear documentation
- Maintain strict type safety with TypeScript
- Use React best practices (hooks, functional components)
- Implement progressive enhancement for authenticated features
- Follow Earth Alliance aesthetic guidelines
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## 5. Data Sources & Integration

### 5.1 Internal Data Sources

- User blockchain wallets and transactions
- Nostr feeds and secure communications
- Starcom intelligence database
- Earth Alliance secure feeds

### 5.2 External APIs (to be implemented)

- Open source intelligence aggregators
- Blockchain explorers and analytics
- Social media monitoring APIs

- Geospatial intelligence sources

## 6. User Experience Guidelines

### 6.1 Authentication & Progressive Enhancement

- Basic OSINT features available without authentication
- Display auth prompts for premium features
- Provide clear value proposition for authentication
- Never expose sensitive features to unauthenticated users

### 6.2 Performance Targets

- Initial load under 3 seconds
- Interactive response under 200ms
- Search results pagination for large datasets
- Virtualization for lists with >100 items
- Background processing for intensive operations

### 6.3 Security Considerations

- Client-side encryption for sensitive data
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Anonymous routing for external queries when possible
- Secure storage with encryption
- Clear security indicators for users

## 7. Testing Strategy

### 7.1 Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all individual components
