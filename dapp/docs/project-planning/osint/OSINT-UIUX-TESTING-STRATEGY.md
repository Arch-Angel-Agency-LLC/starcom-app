## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the OSINT interface, focusing on realistic human interaction simulation. The approach prioritizes unpredictable user behaviors, cognitive factors, and environmental variations to ensure the system performs well under real-world conditions.

## 1. Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach recognizes that humans interact with systems in complex, non-linear ways. Users are distracted, make mistakes, get frustrated, learn over time, and use systems in vastly different environments. Our tests must reflect these realities.

### Core Principles

1. **Embrace Unpredictability**: Human behavior is non-deterministic; our tests should be too
2. **Simulate Cognitive Limitations**: Account for attention spans, learning curves, and mental models
3. **Test Environmental Variation**: Different devices, network conditions, and contexts matter
4. **Include Emotional Factors**: Frustration, satisfaction, and confusion affect user behavior
5. **Test Learning Curves**: First-time users behave differently than experienced ones

## 2. Testing Categories

* Update simulations with new user behavior data

## 4. Test Scenario Examples

### 4.1 Distracted Search Scenario

1. User starts a search query
2. User is interrupted before completing (simulate tab switch)
3. User returns after 30-120 seconds (randomized)
4. User completes original query or starts new one (randomized)
5. System should maintain context and provide appropriate assistance

### 4.2 Frustration Detection Scenario

1. User performs a search with limited results
2. User refines search multiple times with similar limited results
3. User exhibits frustration behavior (rapid clicks, abandoned searches)
4. System should detect frustration pattern and offer alternative approaches

### 4.3 Network Degradation Scenario

1. User begins search with normal network conditions
2. Network degrades during result loading (simulate throttling)
3. User attempts to interact with partially loaded results
4. System should handle partial data and provide appropriate feedback

## 5. Tooling and Infrastructure

### 5.1 Core Testing Tools

* **Jest**: Unit and integration test runner
* **React Testing Library**: Component testing
* **Playwright**: End-to-end testing
* **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: API mocking
