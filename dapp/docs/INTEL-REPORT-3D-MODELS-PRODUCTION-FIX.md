# Intel Report 3D Models Production Fix

**Date:** June 29, 2025  
**Issue:** 3D Intel Report models showing red cone placeholders instead of GLB models in Vercel production  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was in the `vercel.json` configuration where a catch-all rewrite rule was intercepting ALL requests, including static assets like GLB files:

```json
// PROBLEMATIC CONFIGURATION
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "/(.*)",
    "destination": "/index.html"
  }
]
```

This caused requests to `/models/intel_report-01d.glb` to return HTML instead of the actual GLB file, resulting in the error:
```
Error loading Intel Report 3D model: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Fix Applied**

### 1. **Updated vercel.json Rewrite Rules**
```json
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "/((?!models|assets|icons|wasm|.*\\.(glb|gltf|wasm|js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|ico|json|geojson)).*)",
    "destination": "/index.html"
  }
]
```

### 2. **Added Proper MIME Type Headers**
```json
"headers": [
  {
    "source": "/(.*\\.wasm)",
    "headers": [
      {
        "key": "Content-Type",
        "value": "application/wasm"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "source": "/(.*\\.(glb|gltf))",
    "headers": [
      {
        "key": "Content-Type",
        "value": "model/gltf-binary"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### 3. **Enhanced Logging for Debugging**
- Added detailed console logging to track model loading progress
- Clear success/error messages with file paths
- Fallback cone geometry with visual indicators

## ‚úÖ **Verification Steps**

1. **Local Testing:**
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:4173/models/intel_report-01d.glb
   # Should return: Content-Type: model/gltf-binary
   ```

2. **Production Deployment:**
   - Deploy to Vercel with the updated `vercel.json`
   - Check browser console for `‚úÖ Intel Report 3D model loaded successfully`
   - Verify 3D models appear instead of red cone placeholders

## üìÅ **Files Modified**

- `/vercel.json` - Updated rewrite rules and headers
- `/src/hooks/useIntelReport3DMarkers.ts` - Enhanced logging
- `/src/components/Globe/Features/IntelReport3DMarker/IntelReport3DMarker.tsx` - Enhanced logging

## üéØ **Solution Benefits**

- **Minimal Changes:** No major build configuration modifications
- **Production-Safe:** Maintains SPA routing while serving static assets correctly
- **WASM Fix:** Also resolves WebAssembly MIME type issues
- **Debug-Friendly:** Enhanced logging for future troubleshooting

## üöÄ **Ready for Production**

The fix is simple, targeted, and addresses the exact issue without disrupting the existing build process or application functionality.
