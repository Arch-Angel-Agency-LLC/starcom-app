## Screen Components Created
### Main Screens
- `GlobeScreen` - The global view screen
- `NetRunnerScreen` - Dashboard for network exploration and OSINT gathering
  - Implemented with real search functionality
  - Connected to search hook with filtering capabilities
  - UI structure in place for results display
  - Advanced filtering panel with source selection
  - Entity extraction from search results
- `AnalyzerScreen` - Information analysis tools
- `NodeWebScreen` - Visualization of entity relationships
- `TimelineScreen` - Chronological analysis
- `CaseManagerScreen` - Case management tools
- `TeamsScreen` - Team collaboration tools
- `AIAgentScreen` - AI assistant management
- `BotRosterScreen` - Automated agent deployment

### Settings Screens
- `ProfileScreen` - User profile settings
- `AppearanceScreen` - UI customization settings
- `SecurityScreen` - Security settings
- `NotificationsScreen` - Notification preferences
- `AdvancedScreen` - Advanced settings

## Current Structure
- The `ScreenLoader` component handles:
  - Lazy loading of screen components for better performance
  - Fallback to placeholder screens for components still in development
  - Loading and error states
  
- The `MainPage` component now:
  - Uses the `ScreenLoader` to render the current screen
  - Provides the proper screen parameters
  - Maintains the page layout structure with header, navigation, and content areas

## Current Focus: NetRunner Dashboard Enhancement

The NetRunnerDashboard is currently the main focus of development. Current progress:

- Basic search functionality implemented and working
- UI structure in place with Material UI components
- Search results display implemented
- Tab system for different search modes
- Advanced filtering panel with source selection implemented
- Entity extraction from search results implemented
- Two-column layout for results and entity analysis

Immediate enhancements needed:
1. ~~Advanced filtering panel with source selection~~ ✅
2. ~~Entity extraction from search results~~ ✅ 
3. Integration with dark web and blockchain sources
4. OPSEC tools migration from legacy components
5. Data export functionality
6. Integration with NodeWeb for visualization

## Route Synchronization

We've implemented bidirectional synchronization between URL routes and the ViewContext screen system:

- The `useRouteSync` hook provides synchronization logic
- The `RouteSynchronizer` component integrates at app root level
- URL paths are mapped to screen types with parameter preservation
- Browser history works correctly with screen navigation
- Deep linking to specific screens is now supported

## Navigation and Routing Overhaul

We've completely redesigned the routing and navigation structure to provide a more robust, maintainable, and feature-rich system:

### Nested Routing Structure
- Implemented nested routes in React Router for better organization
- Main app routes are now nested under the MainPage component
- Settings routes are nested under the SettingsPage component
- Added support for dynamic route parameters (e.g., `/netrunner/:searchQuery`)
- Improved deep linking and browser history management

### Enhanced MainBottomBar
- Reorganized navigation items into logical categories (Tools, Collaboration, Intelligence)
- Added visual grouping with section headers for better UX
- Implemented direct routing instead of relying solely on ViewContext
- Improved active state detection for nested routes
- Added support for route parameters while maintaining active state

### Bidirectional Synchronization
- Enhanced useRouteSync hook to handle route parameters
- Added protection against circular updates with a ref-based locking mechanism
- Implemented automatic redirection from legacy routes to new route structure
- Improved query parameter handling and preservation
- Added support for extracting route parameters into ViewContext

### New Navigation Pattern
- Component-based navigation now uses direct routing with React Router
- ViewContext is synchronized with routes automatically
- Route parameters are properly extracted and provided to screens
- Navigation state is more predictable and testable
- Browser history now properly reflects application state

These changes create a more maintainable and scalable navigation system that follows React best practices and provides a solid foundation for future development.

## Next Steps

   - Test screen transitions and animations
   - Validate that all screens render correctly

5. **Documentation Updates**

### Context Provider Structure

We've fixed the "useSecureChat must be used within a SecureChatProvider" error by:

1. Moving the `SecureChatProvider` to the top-level `App` component to ensure all components using the `useSecureChat` hook are within its context
2. Removing duplicate `SecureChatProvider` instances from components like `HUDLayout`
3. Ensuring proper nesting of context providers in the component tree

This change ensures:
- Consistent access to secure chat functionality throughout the application
- Elimination of multiple competing providers for the same context
- Cleaner component structure with context providers at the appropriate levels

The fix also resolves issues with navigation conflicts by ensuring there's only one instance of each provider in the component tree.

## Fixed Issues and Technical Enhancements

### SecureChatProvider Error Resolution
We addressed the "useSecureChat must be used within a SecureChatProvider" error by implementing a proper provider hierarchy:

1. **Problem**: Components using the `useSecureChat` hook were not properly wrapped in a `SecureChatProvider`, causing React context errors.

2. **Solution**:
   - Moved the `SecureChatProvider` to the top-level `App` component
   - Ensured proper nesting with other context providers
   - Removed duplicate providers from lower-level components like `HUDLayout`

3. **Benefits**:
   - All components now have access to secure chat functionality
   - Eliminated context duplication issues
   - Simplified component structure
   - Resolved navigation conflicts caused by competing providers

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - Updated `App.tsx` to include `SecureChatProvider` at the appropriate level
   - Removed `SecureChatProvider` from `HUDLayout` to prevent duplication
   - Verified all components using `useSecureChat` are properly wrapped

This fix is part of our broader effort to ensure proper context management throughout the application, which is critical for maintaining a stable navigation system and preventing unexpected behavior.

## Troubleshooting and Common Issues

### Context Provider Issues

#### "useSecureChat must be used within a SecureChatProvider"
- **Symptom**: Error message "useSecureChat must be used within a SecureChatProvider" appears in console
- **Cause**: Component using the `useSecureChat` hook is not within the scope of a `SecureChatProvider`
- **Solution**: 
  - Ensure `SecureChatProvider` is present in the component tree above any component using `useSecureChat`
  - Check for duplicate providers that might cause context conflicts
  - Verify the provider hierarchy in `App.tsx`

#### Provider Duplication Issues
- **Symptom**: Inconsistent state, navigation loops, or context values not updating properly
- **Cause**: Multiple instances of the same provider in the component tree
- **Solution**:
  - Keep providers at the appropriate level in the component hierarchy
  - Remove duplicate providers from lower-level components
  - Follow the provider structure outlined in the navigation architecture documentation
