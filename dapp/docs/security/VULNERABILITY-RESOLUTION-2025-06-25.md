# Security Vulnerability Resolution - IME Development

## Issue
During Intelligence Market Exchange development, the addition of Solana marketplace dependencies introduced **13 security vulnerabilities** (2 moderate, 10 high, 1 critical).

## Root Cause
Added dependencies for Solana program development pulled in vulnerable transitive dependencies:
- `@solana/spl-token` → vulnerable versions of `bigint-buffer` 
- `@pinata/sdk` → vulnerable versions of `axios`
- `ipfs-http-client` → vulnerable versions of `nanoid` and `parse-duration`
- `web3.storage` → additional IPFS vulnerabilities
- `pbkdf2` → critical vulnerability in crypto operations

## Resolution
1. **Removed problematic packages**: Uninstalled `@solana/spl-token`, `@pinata/sdk`, `ipfs-http-client`, and `web3.storage`
2. **Applied security fixes**: Ran `npm audit fix` to resolve the remaining pbkdf2 vulnerability
3. **Verified security**: Confirmed **0 vulnerabilities** restored

## Current Status
✅ **Zero vulnerabilities** - security posture restored to pristine level  
✅ **Core functionality maintained** - Anchor framework and wallet adapters still available  
✅ **IME development continues** - Can proceed with secure Solana program implementation

## Next Steps for IME
- Continue with secure Anchor program development
- When NFT functionality needed, carefully select latest secure versions
- Use alternative secure storage solutions for IPFS functionality
- Implement proper dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Security Lessons
- Always run `npm audit` after adding new dependencies
- Review transitive dependencies for security vulnerabilities  
- Prioritize security over feature velocity
- Maintain zero-vulnerability baseline for government/SOCOM applications
