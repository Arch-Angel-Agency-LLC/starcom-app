# Bug Fix Report - Duplicate Keys and Runtime Errors

## Date: June 21, 2025

## Issues Identified

### 1. Duplicate Key Warnings in ThreatHorizonFeed
**Error**: React warning about duplicate keys (`threat-001`, `threat-002`, `threat-003`) in ThreatHorizonFeed component.

**Root Cause**: Mock data generators in `aiService.ts` were using hardcoded IDs, causing multiple threats to have the same ID when generated at different times.

**Solution**: Modified all mock data generators to use timestamp-based unique IDs:
- `generateMockThreatIndicators()`: Changed from `'threat-001'` to `` `threat-${baseTime}-001` ``
- `generateMockInsights()`: Changed from `'insight-001'` to `` `insight-${baseTime}-001` ``
- `generateMockActionRecommendations()`: Changed from `'action-priority-001'` to `` `action-priority-${baseTime}-001` ``

### 2. Runtime Error in Globe3DView.tsx
**Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'activeInsights')` at line 151.

**Root Cause**: Globe3DView was trying to access `enhancedState.aiInsightState.activeInsights` but:
1. The property name was incorrect (should be `aiState` not `aiInsightState`)
2. The nested property was incorrect (should be `recentInsights` not `activeInsights`)
3. No null-safety checks were in place

**Solution**: Fixed the property access with proper null-safety:
```tsx
// Before (incorrect)
<div>AI: {enhancedState.aiInsightState.activeInsights.length}</div>

// After (correct)
<div>AI: {enhancedState.aiState?.recentInsights?.length || 0}</div>
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/services/aiService.ts**
   - Updated `generateMockThreatIndicators()` to use unique timestamp-based IDs
   - Updated `generateMockInsights()` to use unique timestamp-based IDs  
   - Updated `generateMockActionRecommendations()` to use unique timestamp-based IDs
   - Updated all nested action and step IDs to be unique

2. **src/components/HUD/Center/Globe3DView.tsx**
   - Fixed property access from `aiInsightState.activeInsights` to `aiState?.recentInsights`
   - Added null-safety checks with optional chaining
   - Added fallback value of 0 for undefined cases

## Testing

- Started development server on http://localhost:5174
- Both issues should now be resolved:
  - No more duplicate key warnings in React console
  - No more runtime errors when Globe3DView renders
  - AI insights count displays correctly with proper null-safety

## Impact

- **Performance**: Eliminated React warnings that could impact performance
- **Stability**: Removed runtime errors that could crash the Globe3DView component
- **User Experience**: AI insights count now displays reliably
- **Development**: Console is cleaner, making it easier to spot real issues

## Next Steps

Continue with Phase 3 implementation as outlined in the MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md:
- Multi-Agency Collaboration features
- Real AI service integration
- Production optimizations
