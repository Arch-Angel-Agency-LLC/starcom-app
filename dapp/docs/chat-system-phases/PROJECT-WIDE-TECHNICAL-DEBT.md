## Project-Wide Technical Debt Analysis

While reviewing the chat system, we've identified several critical infrastructure issues that extend beyond just the chat functionality. These fundamental problems need urgent attention as they affect core application stability:

1. **Missing Service Implementation**:
   - `NostrService.getInstance is not a function` error indicates incomplete service implementation
   - Other services may have similar implementation gaps
   - Inconsistent singleton pattern usage across services

2. **Architectural Inconsistencies**:
   - Mixed usage of direct service calls and context providers
   - Incomplete migrations between architectural patterns
   - Inconsistent error handling approaches

3. **Dependency Management Issues**:
   - Direct dependencies on protocol-specific implementations
   - Missing null/undefined checks in critical components
   - Potential circular dependencies in service initialization

4. **Error Handling Gaps**:
   - Missing try/catch blocks in async operations
   - Unhandled promises in UI components
   - Lack of graceful degradation when services fail

5. **UI Component Stability**:
   - Brittle component dependencies on service availability
   - Missing fallback UI states
   - Inadequate loading states during async operations

These issues represent significant technical debt that must be addressed alongside the specific NostrService implementation problems. The emergency stabilization phase should include a broader audit to identify similar issues across the application.
