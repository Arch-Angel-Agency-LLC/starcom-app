## üéØ **Earth Alliance Mission**

### **Planetary Reclamation Operations**
- **Truth Restoration**: Immutable evidence storage exposing multi-millennial deceptions
- **System Reclamation**: Replace captured institutions with transparent governance
- **Global Coordination**: Censorship-resistant communication for worldwide reclamation cells
- **Whistleblower Protection**: Secure evidence submission with financial rewards
- **Timeline Restoration**: Secure humanity's natural evolutionary path by 2030

### **Operational Context**
- **Situation**: Transnational crime syndicate (banking cartels + death cult) occupying planetary governance
- **Scope**: Multi-millennial systemic occupation across all nation-states  
- **Mission**: Complete planetary reclamation and restoration of natural order
- **Strategy**: Decentralized, quantum-safe, censorship-resistant reclamation platform

**NOT RESISTANCE - RECLAMATION**
*We're not fighting the system. We're taking our planet back.*

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **Core Technologies**
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **3D Visualization**: Three.js global interface  
- **Blockchain**: Solana + Ethereum (decentralized economy)
- **Communications**: Nostr protocol (censorship-resistant)
- **Storage**: IPFS (immutable evidence preservation)
- **Security**: Post-Quantum Cryptography (future-proof)
- **Intelligence**: Truth markets with economic incentives

### **Security Baseline**
- **SOCOM Standards**: Military cybersecurity requirements as minimum baseline
- **Enhanced for Resistance**: Decentralized architecture exceeds centralized security
- **Quantum-Safe**: Post-quantum cryptography for future threat protection
- **Censorship-Resistant**: Multiple pathways prevent coordinated shutdown
- **Anti-Fragile**: System strengthens under attack

## üõ°Ô∏è **Operational Security**

### **Earth Alliance Safety Protocols**
- **Testing**: Use `npm run test:safe` (prevents system freezes)
- **Storage**: 2MB browser limit enforced (prevents tracking)
- **Communications**: Quantum-safe encryption mandatory
- **Evidence**: Immutable IPFS storage with cryptographic verification
- **Identity**: Self-sovereign authentication (no government dependencies)

### **Documentation Structure**
