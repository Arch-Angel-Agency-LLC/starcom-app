### 1. Introduction
The Intelligence Exchange Marketplace (IEM) is an open, decentralized platform for the secure, on-chain exchange of intelligence reports, signals, and digital assets. Designed for transparency, auditability, and global collaboration, IEM leverages Solana blockchain technology and a serverless, wallet-authenticated architecture.

### 2. Purpose and Scope
- Enable the creation, minting, and exchange of intelligence reports as NFTs and SPL tokens.
- Provide a decentralized, censorship-resistant platform for cyber investigations, intelligence sharing, and financial analysis.
- Ensure all data flows are on-chain, cryptographically signed, and accessible via open APIs.

### 3. Architecture Overview
- **Serverless:** All logic is client-side or on-chain; no backend or centralized server is required.
- **Wallet-Authenticated:** All actions require Solana wallet signatures for authentication and access control.
- **On-Chain Data:** Intelligence reports, overlays, and market data are stored and validated on Solana.
- **Open API:** All data and actions are accessible via open, documented APIs using `@solana/web3.js`.

### 4. Key Features
- **Intel Report NFTs:** Mint, transfer, and verify provenance of intelligence reports as NFTs.
- **SPL Token Minting:** Create and exchange custom tokens representing intelligence value or access.
- **Live Overlays:** Visualize intelligence data on a 3D globe interface with real-time, on-chain overlays.
- **Marketplace:** Buy, sell, and trade intelligence assets in a decentralized, transparent market.
- **Auditability:** All transactions and data are publicly auditable and cryptographically secure.

### 5. Security and Openness
- All code, artifacts, and documentation are published under a permissive open source license.
- No proprietary or closed-source components are used.
- All smart contracts, APIs, and UI logic are documented and reference relevant artifacts.
- Security audits and code health reports are maintained as part of the artifact-driven workflow.
