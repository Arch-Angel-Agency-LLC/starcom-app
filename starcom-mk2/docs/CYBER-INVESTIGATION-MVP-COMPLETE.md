# Cyber Investigation MVP - Complete Implementation

## Overview
A fully functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for small remote cyber investigation teams (3-9 people) using OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques. The MVP is now integrated into the main Starcom application and accessible at `/cyber-investigation`.

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- **Intel Report Submission**: Secure submission of intelligence reports with offline support
- **Team Communication**: Real-time chat and direct messaging capabilities  
- **Intel Report Viewer**: Browse, search, and filter submitted intelligence reports
- **Offline/Online Sync**: Automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored
- **Authentication**: Protected routes using wallet-based authentication

### Technical Features
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Offline Storage**: Local storage for data when offline
- **Real-time Status**: Online/offline indicators and sync status
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface with visual status indicators

## Component Architecture

### Main Components
1. **CyberInvestigationMVP.tsx** - Main container with navigation and view routing
2. **IntelReportSubmission.tsx** - Form for submitting new intel reports
3. **TeamCommunication.tsx** - Chat interface for team coordination
4. **IntelReportViewer.tsx** - Browse and search existing reports
5. **OfflineSync.tsx** - Manage data synchronization and queue status

### Navigation Structure
- **Dashboard** - Overview with status cards and quick actions
- **Submit Report** - Protected intel report submission form
- **Reports** - View and search existing intelligence reports
- **Chat** - Protected team communication interface
- **Sync** - Offline data management and synchronization

## Usage

### Accessing the MVP
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5174/cyber-investigation`
3. For protected features (Submit Reports, Chat), connect a wallet

### Key User Flows

#### Submitting Intel Reports
1. Click "Submit Report" or navigate to the submit tab
2. Authenticate with wallet if not already connected
3. Fill out the intel report form with:
   - Report title and description
   - Intelligence type (HUMINT, SIGINT, OSINT, etc.)
   - Priority level (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
   - Geographic coordinates (optional)
   - File attachments (optional)
4. Submit - data is stored locally if offline, synced when online

#### Team Communication
1. Navigate to Chat tab
2. Authenticate with wallet
3. Send team messages or direct messages
4. Messages are queued locally when offline

#### Viewing Reports
1. Navigate to Reports tab
2. Browse all submitted intelligence reports
3. Use search and filter capabilities
4. View detailed report information

#### Managing Offline Data
1. Navigate to Sync tab
2. View pending sync items
3. Monitor synchronization status
4. Manually trigger sync operations

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
- Uses existing authentication system (AuthGate)
- Leverages Solana wallet adapter
