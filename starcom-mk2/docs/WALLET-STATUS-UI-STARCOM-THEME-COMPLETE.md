## Updates Applied

### **üêõ Bug Fixes - Round 1**

#### **Issue 1: White Background in Modal**
- **Problem**: The shared `Modal` component had hardcoded white background that was overriding the Starcom theme
- **Solution**: Updated `Modal.tsx` to use transparent background and removed default padding/shadows to let child components control their own styling
- **Result**: The wallet status modal now displays with proper Starcom dark theme without white boundaries

#### **Issue 2: "Wallet Not Connected" False Positive**
- **Problem**: Connection detection logic was too strict, only checking `connectionStatus === 'connected'`
- **Solution**: Enhanced connection detection to be more robust:
  ```typescript
  const isWalletConnected = (connectionStatus === 'connected' || !!address) && !error;
  ```
- **Added**: Debug logging to help diagnose connection issues
- **Added**: Development-only diagnostic overlay to track wallet state in real-time

### **üîß Enhanced Features**

#### **Better Error Messages**
- Updated button text to be more descriptive ("RETRY CONNECTION" vs "RETRY")
- Added professional security language throughout

#### **Development Diagnostics**
- **Temporary Diagnostic Component**: Added `WalletDiagnostic.tsx` that shows real-time wallet status
- **Debug Logging**: Added console logging for connection states
- **Visual Debug Info**: Shows connection details in development mode

### **üß™ Testing Tools Added**

1. **WalletDiagnostic Component** - Shows real-time wallet state
2. **Console Debugging** - Logs connection changes
3. **Visual Debug Overlay** - Development-only status indicator

## Files Modified
- `src/components/Auth/WalletStatusMini.tsx` - Complete component rewrite
- `src/components/Auth/WalletStatusMini.module.css` - Complete CSS redesign

The transformation successfully elevates the wallet status from a basic utility widget to a professional command center interface appropriate for cyber intelligence analysts and investigators.
