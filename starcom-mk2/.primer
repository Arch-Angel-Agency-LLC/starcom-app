# AI Quickstart (Read First)
- **When in doubt:** Add a `TODO:` with your question and reference the relevant artifact or doc.
- **Always:**
  - Check for existing artifacts, modules, or docs before generating new code.
  - Link new code to artifacts and update docs.
  - Use short, clear comments and repeat key terms (see Glossary).
  - Leave `AI-NOTE:` comments for non-obvious logic or context for future agents.
- **Context Window:**
  - You can only see ~25-75 lines at a time. Chunk your work. Use file/folder names and section headers as anchors.
  - Use the directory structure and `docs/` for navigation and context.

# Key Technologies
- React, TypeScript, Vite
- Rust/WASM modules
- Solidity (web3 integration)
- Artifact-driven development

# Guiding Principles
- Modularity, extensibility, security, traceability
- AI-augmented, artifact-driven workflows
- Consistency in naming, structure, and documentation

# Glossary & NLP Anchors
- **Artifact**: Modular, versioned unit of knowledge (code, test, doc, design)
- **Module**: Self-contained code unit (component, service, contract, etc.)
- **Context**: All information needed to understand or generate code
- **Cache**: Storage for temporary or computed data
- **TODO**: Marker for unresolved questions or missing context
- **AI-NOTE**: Structured comment for future AI agents

# AI Agent Protocols
- If context is missing or ambiguous, create a TODO with a specific question and reference the relevant artifact or doc.
- Always check for existing artifacts, modules, or documentation before generating new code.
- When generating or updating code, link it to relevant artifacts and update documentation.
- Leave structured comments for future AI agents (e.g., `AI-NOTE:`).
- Use short, declarative sentences and consistent terminology in all documentation and comments.

# Common AI Pitfalls & Mitigations
- **Duplication**: Always search for existing code or artifacts before creating new ones.
- **Ambiguity**: If unsure, escalate with a TODO and reference the artifact or doc.
- **Edge Cases**: Check for edge cases and document assumptions.
- **Semantic Drift**: Ensure code changes are reflected in related artifacts and docs.

# Meta-Coordination for AI Agents
- Leave breadcrumbs: Use `AI-NOTE:` comments to explain non-obvious decisions or context for future agents.
- Use structured TODOs: `TODO: [QUESTION] — [FILE/ARTIFACT]`
- Document all new or updated artifacts in `artifacts/` and/or `docs/`.

# File/Folder Index (See directory structure)
- Use `src/`, `artifacts/`, `docs/`, `contracts/`, `wasm-ephemeris/`, etc. as anchors for navigation.
- Refer to `directory-structure.txt` for a full map.

# Audience
- Cyber investigators, intelligence analysts, financial analysts, global monitoring teams
- AI agents (Copilot, GPT, etc.)

Prioritize clarity, traceability, and context. This .primer is your anchor—refer to it often. Chunk your work and use anchors for navigation.
