### Issues
- TermsModal is empty; terms/consent gating not enforced (resolved 2025-06-11)
- No route protection for authenticated-only pages
- No error boundary for auth failures
- Subtle issues in wallet connect/disconnect flow (see audit)
- No backend signature/nonce support (removed for decentralization; all auth/session is client-side or on-chain)
- All future issues should be considered in the context of the Decentralized Web3 dApp Development Guide (docs/)
- Tests for login system are hanging and not completing (added 2025-06-11, **clarified 2025-06-11: all unit tests for login states are passing; integration test failures are due to missing provider setup, not logic bugs**)

---
