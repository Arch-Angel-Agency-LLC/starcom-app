# TinyGlobe Refactor Plan (2025-06-13)

## Goal
Make TinyGlobe visualizations match the main Globe as closely as possible, using the same rendering pipeline, materials, and configuration.

## Steps
1. Remove custom shader/material assignment in TinyGlobe except for special modes.
2. Pass the same props to TinyGlobe as the main Globe (globeImageUrl, showAtmosphere, etc.).
3. Sync visualization mode and submode logic with the main Globe.
4. Align lighting setup with the main Globe (remove extra lights if present).
5. Clean up unused state, refs, and effect hooks related to custom shaders/materials.
6. Optionally, increase TinyGlobe canvas size for clarity.
7. Test TinyGlobe in all modes for visual consistency.

## Notes
- Only use custom shaders in TinyGlobe for special visualization modes (e.g., hologram).
- Default to react-globe.gl's built-in material and atmosphere for standard modes.
- Document any deviations or issues during the refactor.
