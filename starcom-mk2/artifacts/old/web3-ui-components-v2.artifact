# Web3 UI Components v2 Artifact

## Purpose
Documents reusable UI components for wallet feedback, dialogs, and notifications.

## Components
- **Modal/Popup:** Centralized, accessible modal for all dialogs (error, confirmation, session expiry, etc.).
- **Snackbar/Toast:** For transient success/info messages (e.g., "Wallet connected!").
- **Tooltip:** For help/info on actions (connect, authenticate, switch network).
- **Session Expiry Countdown:** Shows time left, triggers warning popup.
- **Network Info Banner:** Persistent display of current and expected network.

## Requirements
- All components must be accessible and responsive.
- Modals/dialogs must trap focus and use ARIA roles.

## AI-NOTE:
Update this artifact as new components are added or requirements change.
