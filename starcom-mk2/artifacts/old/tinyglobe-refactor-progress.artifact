# TinyGlobe Refactor Progress Log (2025-06-13)

## Purpose
Track each step, decision, and issue encountered during the TinyGlobe visualization refactor.

## Log Entries
- **[x] Step 1:** Remove custom shader/material assignment (except special modes)
  - Refactored: Only apply custom shaders for 'hologram' mode. For all other modes, do not override the default react-globe.gl material.
  - Removed scene traversal and material assignment for standard modes.
  - Kept custom shader logic for 'hologram' mode only.
  - Documented in tinyglobe-refactor-progress.artifact
- **[x] Step 2:** Pass same props as main Globe
  - Completed: TinyGlobe now uses the same globeImageUrl, showAtmosphere, atmosphereColor, and atmosphereAltitude as the main Globe, based on visualization mode/submode.
  - Uses shared visualizationConfig and logic for prop selection.
- **[x] Step 3:** Sync mode/submode logic
  - Completed: TinyGlobe and GlobeView both use the same logic and config for visualization mode and submode.
  - Ensures TinyGlobe and GlobeView are always in sync for mode/submode.
- **[x] Step 4:** Align lighting
  - Completed: No extra or custom lighting is present in TinyGlobe for standard modes. Lighting is now consistent with GlobeView.
- **[x] Step 5:** Clean up code
  - Completed: Unused state, refs, and effect hooks related to custom shaders/materials have been removed for standard modes. Only special modes retain custom logic.
- **[ ] Step 6:** Test all modes
  - Plan: After refactor, test TinyGlobe in all visualization modes and submodes to ensure visual consistency with GlobeView.
- **[ ] Step 7:** Document results
  - Plan: Document any issues, deviations, or lessons learned during the refactor in this artifact.

## Completion Criteria
- TinyGlobe visuals match main Globe in all standard modes.
- Special modes (e.g., hologram) retain unique effects.
- All changes are documented and tested.
