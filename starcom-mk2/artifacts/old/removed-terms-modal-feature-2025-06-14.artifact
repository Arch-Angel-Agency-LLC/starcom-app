# Removed Feature: TermsModal (Web3 Login Gating)

## Date
2025-06-14

## Summary
The TermsModal feature, which enforced user acceptance of terms before allowing access to the app or wallet connection, has been removed. Users are now dropped directly into the app for best UX. Login is handled via the in-app WalletStatus button.

## Reason for Removal
- Outdated design: The modal was based on an old requirement.
- Improved UX: Users should access the app immediately without gating.
- Redundant: WalletStatus already handles login.

## Files Removed/Updated
- `src/App.tsx`: TermsModal gating logic removed.
- `src/components/Auth/TermsModal.tsx`: Component removed.
- `src/components/Auth/TermsModal.test.tsx`: Tests removed.

## Artifact Protocol
- Reference this artifact if questions arise about the removal of the TermsModal feature.
