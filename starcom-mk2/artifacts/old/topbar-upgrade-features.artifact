# TopBar Settings & Marquee Features (Unified, Canonical Implementation)

## Purpose
Document requirements and design for the TopBar settings popup and marquee, with all development consolidated in TopBar.tsx. Artifact-driven files are deprecated.

## Requirements
- All TopBar development and refactoring must occur in TopBar.tsx (canonical file).
- Integrate real data for all categories (commodities, indices, crypto, forex, economic, news, sentiment) via hooks/services.
- Add a settings button to the TopBar.
- Clicking the button opens a modal/popup with a scrollable list of checkboxes.
- Each checkbox represents a data category (see Data Categories artifact).
- User selections are stored in React state and persisted (e.g., localStorage).
- The TopBar only displays data points for enabled categories.
- The settings popup is accessible and mobile-friendly.
- Marquee is a horizontally scrolling ticker, auto-scrolls, pauses on hover, and updates in real time.
- All code must be robust, accessible, and testable per artifacts.

## Extensibility
- New categories can be added by updating the data categories and data hook.
- User preferences persist across sessions.

## Migration Note
- Remove/deprecate all artifact-driven or experimental TopBar files. Use only TopBar.tsx.
- Refactor and test in-place.
