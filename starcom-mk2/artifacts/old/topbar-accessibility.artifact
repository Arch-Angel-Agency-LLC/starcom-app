# TopBar Accessibility Artifact (Canonical)

## Purpose
Document accessibility requirements and best practices for the TopBar settings modal, checkboxes, and marquee. All requirements apply to TopBar.tsx and its components.

## Modal/Popup
- Use ARIA role="dialog" and aria-modal="true".
- Trap focus within modal when open.
- Dismissible by ESC key and clicking outside.
- Label modal with a heading (e.g., "Settings").

## Checkbox List
- Each checkbox has a label and is keyboard accessible.
- Use aria-checked and aria-labelledby as needed.

## Marquee
- Pauses on hover for screen readers and keyboard users.
- Use aria-live="polite" for dynamic updates.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast and readable font size.

## General
- All interactive elements are reachable by keyboard.
- Provide visible focus indicators.

## Implementation Steps
- Use `focus-trap-react` or similar for modal focus management.
- Modal: `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, labelled by heading.
- ESC key and outside click close modal (test with screen reader).
- Tab/Shift+Tab cycles through modal controls only.
- Checkboxes: `<input type="checkbox">` with `aria-checked`, labelled by category label and icon.
- Marquee: `aria-live="polite"`, pause on hover/tap, ensure keyboard access.
- Test with Axe, VoiceOver/NVDA, and keyboard only.

## Screen Reader Checklist
- Modal opens/closes are announced.
- Checkbox state changes are announced.
- Marquee updates are announced but not spammy.

## Library Recommendations
- `focus-trap-react` for modal
- `react-aria-live` for dynamic updates
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` for accessibility assertions
