## Purpose
Track the phased migration for each data domain and consumer, with actionable steps, ownership, and validation.

## Validation Steps
- For each phase, specify integration test, canary deploy, and artifact update requirements.
- Link to relevant test cases and CI jobs.
- Document rollback plan (feature flag, revert, etc.) for each domain.

## Lessons Learned
- Record issues, blockers, and best practices discovered during migration.

## Artifact Cross-Links
- See also: data-service-interfaces, testing-strategy, observability artifacts for requirements and test cases.
