# TopBar Testing & QA Artifact (Canonical)

## Purpose
Define the testing strategy, required test cases, and coverage goals for the TopBar settings and marquee features. All tests must target TopBar.tsx and its components.

## Test Strategy
- Unit tests for all new components (SettingsPopup, Marquee, TopBar logic)
- Integration tests for state management and data flow
- E2E tests for user interaction (settings, toggling, marquee updates)
- All tests must use real data, not placeholders.

## Required Test Cases
- Modal opens/closes via button, ESC, and outside click
- Checkbox toggles update state and persist to localStorage
- Marquee displays only enabled categories and updates in real time
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, focus trap, ARIA roles
- Error handling: missing data, failed fetch, missing icons/labels
- Responsiveness: mobile/desktop layout, overflow handling
- Performance: smooth marquee with many data points, no excessive re-renders

## Coverage Goals
- 100% unit test coverage for new logic
- 90%+ integration/E2E coverage for user flows and edge cases

## Tools
- React Testing Library, Jest, Cypress (or Playwright)
- Axe for accessibility checks
