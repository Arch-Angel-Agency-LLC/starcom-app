# Test Suite Conventions Artifact

## Naming
- Use `*.test.ts(x)` for unit/integration tests.
- Use `*.e2e.test.ts(x)` for end-to-end tests.
- Use `*.spec.ts(x)` for special or legacy cases.

## Placement
- Place tests next to the code they test.
- Use `test-utils/` for shared utilities.
- Use `shared-tests/` for cross-cutting or multi-module tests.
- Use `legacy-tests/` for obsolete or deprecated tests (flag for review).

## Test Types
- Unit: Isolated, fast, no external dependencies.
- Integration: Multiple modules/components together.
- E2E: Full app, user flows, in `cypress/`.

## Best Practices
- Mock external dependencies and side effects.
- Use clear, descriptive test names and comments.
- Maintain high coverage (min 80%) and meaningful assertions.
- Add `AI-NOTE:` for non-obvious logic or context.
- Add `TODO:` for ambiguous or incomplete migrations.
- Reference `.primer` and ONBOARDING.md for project-wide conventions.

## Enforcement
- Lint/test runner checks for placement, naming, and coverage.
- CI must fail if conventions are violated.

## Version
- v2 (2025-06-12)

## Changelog
- v2: Added shared/legacy conventions, coverage threshold, AI-NOTE/TODO, enforcement, and versioning.
- v1: Initial draft.
