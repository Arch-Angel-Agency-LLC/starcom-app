# Intelligence Exchange Market (IEM) — API Integration Artifact (Serverless, Fully Decentralized)

## Purpose
Document the API layer for intelligence data, including direct connections to Solana smart contracts and UI. All logic is on-chain or in the client; no backend, CLI, or server is used or required.

## API Endpoints and Data Flows
- `fetchIntelReports()`: Fetches all intelligence reports directly from Solana accounts using `@solana/web3.js`.
- `submitIntelReport(report)`: Submits a new intelligence report by sending a transaction to the Solana program using `@solana/web3.js` and wallet signature.

**Data Flow:**
- UI calls API functions in `src/api/intelligence.ts`.
- API functions interact directly with Solana smart contracts via `@solana/web3.js`.
- All authentication, access control, and validation are enforced by wallet signatures and on-chain program logic.

## Serverless Security and Access Control
- All actions require wallet authentication (signature) via the user's wallet (e.g., Phantom).
- Access control is enforced by the Solana program (e.g., only the author can edit/delete their report).
- All data is validated both client-side and on-chain.
- No sensitive data is ever exposed or handled by a server.

## Migration Plan (Stubs → Live Serverless API)
1. Maintain current stubs for frontend development.
2. Implement direct Solana contract endpoints for fetching and submitting reports using `@solana/web3.js`.
3. Integrate wallet authentication and access control in the client and on-chain.
4. Replace stubs with live, on-chain integration; update this artifact and code comments.
