## Title
Comprehensive Audit of Login & Web3 Authentication Code (June 2025)

## Summary

## 0. Change Log
- 2025-06-11: Initial audit and artifact creation by Copilot.
- 2025-06-11: Upgrade with direct file/line references, cross-links, and actionable TODOs.

---

## 1. Context & Hooks

- **src/context/AuthContext.ts** (lines 1–25)
  - Defines `AuthContextType` interface: `isAuthenticated`, `address`, `provider`, `signer`, `connectWallet`, `disconnectWallet`, `isLoading`, `error`, `connectionStatus`, `switchNetwork`.
  - Exports the `AuthContext` React context.

- **src/context/AuthContext.tsx** (lines 1–80)
  - Implements the `AuthProvider` component.
  - Manages wallet state, loading, error, and provides handlers for connecting/disconnecting wallet.
  - Uses `connectToWallet`, `disconnectWallet`, and `isWalletConnected` from `utils/wallet`.
  - Handles auto-connection on mount if wallet is already connected.
  - Provides all authentication state and actions via context.

- **src/context/useAuth.ts** (lines 1–10)
  - Exports the `useAuth` hook for consuming the `AuthContext`.

---

## 2. UI Components

- **src/components/Auth/WalletStatus.tsx** (lines 1–60)
  - UI for wallet connection status.
  - Uses `useAuth` to access authentication state and actions.
  - Renders connect/disconnect/switch network buttons and error/loading states.

- **src/components/Auth/TermsModal.tsx** (empty)
  - Exists but is currently empty. No terms/consent gating is implemented yet.
  - TODO: Implement terms/consent modal and require acceptance before wallet connection.

---

## 3. Utility Functions

- **src/utils/wallet.ts** (lines 1–80)
  - `connectToWallet(targetChainId)`: Connects to MetaMask, requests accounts, checks network, returns wallet connection.
  - `disconnectWallet()`: Stub (MetaMask does not support programmatic disconnect).
  - `isWalletConnected()`: Checks if wallet is connected.
  - `switchNetwork(chainId)`: Requests network switch in MetaMask.

---

## 4. Middleware

- **src/middleware/web3Middleware.ts** (lines 1–40)
  - `requireWalletConnection`: Ensures wallet is connected before running a callback.
  - `fetchWalletBalance`: Placeholder for fetching wallet balance.
  - `verifyNetwork`: Throws if the connected network is not the expected one.

---

## 5. Hooks

- **src/hooks/useWallet.ts** (lines 1–50)
  - Custom hook for wallet state, balance fetching, and network validation.
  - Uses `fetchWalletBalance` and `switchNetwork` from middleware.

---

## 6. Routing & App Shell

- No login/auth UI or logic is present in the main app shell (`src/App.tsx`), main page, or settings page.
- No route protection or login gating is currently implemented.
- TODO: Add route protection for authenticated-only pages.

---

## 7. Known Issues & TODOs
- Subtle issues exist in the login flow (see project notes and future audits).
- No terms/consent gating is enforced (see `TermsModal.tsx`).
- No support for JWT/session or traditional login (by design).
- No user profile or persistent user data beyond wallet address.
- No error boundary for authentication failures.

---

## 8. Cross-References
- See also: `artifacts/onboarding-copilot-improvement.artifact`, `artifacts/starcom-mk2-repo-migration.artifact`.
- Project protocols: `.primer`, `ONBOARDING.md`.

---

## 9. Recommendations (Actionable)
- [ ] Implement terms/consent gating in `TermsModal.tsx` and require acceptance before wallet connect.
- [ ] Add route protection for pages/components that require authentication.
- [ ] Add error boundary or fallback UI for authentication failures.
- [ ] Document any future changes in this artifact and update references in `.primer` and `ONBOARDING.md`.
- [ ] Consider adding user profile support if needed for future features.
