# Web3 Network Config v3 Artifact

## Purpose
Defines supported blockchain networks, their chain IDs, and how the v3 app determines which network to use.

## Supported Networks
- Ethereum Mainnet: `chainId: 1` (name: Mainnet)
- Sepolia Testnet: `chainId: 11155111` (name: Sepolia)

### Chain ID to Network Name Mapping
| Chain ID    | Network Name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Mainnet      |
| 11155111    | Sepolia      |

## Environment Variable
- `VITE_EXPECTED_CHAIN_ID`
  - Set in `.env` files.
  - Used by the app to determine the required network for wallet connections.

## Usage
- On wallet connect, the app checks the current network against `VITE_EXPECTED_CHAIN_ID`.
- If mismatched, the app prompts the user to switch networks via the Account Info Popup.

## Extending for Additional Networks
- Add new chain IDs and names to the mapping above.
- Update UI logic to recognize and display new networks.
- Update `.env` files as needed for new environments.

## Code Reference
- Consumed in: `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`, `Web3LoginPanel.tsx`.
- Update this artifact and code references if logic changes.

## AI-NOTE:
Update this artifact if new networks are supported or the config logic changes.
