# Foundation Upgrade Plan (Starcom App MK2)

## Executive Summary
The project has reached critical mass requiring foundational architecture upgrades to support scale, performance, and maintainability. Memory issues during builds indicate dependency bloat and need for optimization.

## Current State Analysis
- **Codebase**: 224 TS/TSX files, 1.8GB node_modules, 522 dependencies
- **Build**: Memory overflow, 15MB dist, 2.9MB main chunk
- **Architecture**: Multi-language (React/TS, Rust/WASM, Solana), artifact-driven
- **Dependencies**: Mixed EVM/Solana, legacy polyfills, redundant packages

## Phase 1: Dependency Optimization (Priority: HIGH)

### 1.1 Dependency Audit & Cleanup
- [ ] Remove duplicate/conflicting packages (React 16 vs 18 conflicts)
- [ ] Eliminate unused dependencies (identify via `depcheck`)
- [ ] Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives
- [ ] Consolidate overlapping functionality (multiple crypto libs)

### 1.2 Bundle Optimization
- [ ] Implement dynamic imports for large chunks
- [ ] Tree-shaking optimization for unused code
- [ ] Code splitting by route/feature
- [ ] Lazy loading for non-critical modules

### 1.3 Build System Enhancement
- [ ] Upgrade to latest Vite (performance improvements)
- [ ] Implement build caching strategies
- [ ] Optimize chunk splitting configuration
- [ ] Add build performance monitoring

## Phase 2: Monorepo Architecture (Priority: MEDIUM)

### 2.1 Workspace Structure
```

│   └── scripts/            # Automation scripts
└── docs/                   # Documentation
```

### 2.2 Package Management
- [ ] Implement workspace dependencies (`npm workspaces`)
- [ ] Shared build configurations
- [ ] Centralized dependency management
- [ ] Cross-package type sharing

## Phase 3: Performance Architecture (Priority: HIGH)

### 3.1 Module Federation
- [ ] Federated architecture for independent deployments
- [ ] Runtime module loading
- [ ] Reduced bundle sizes
- [ ] Independent team development

### 3.2 Caching Strategy
- [ ] Build cache (Nx, Turborepo, or custom)
- [ ] Runtime caching for expensive operations
- [ ] Persistent cache for development
- [ ] CDN optimization for static assets

### 3.3 WASM Integration Optimization
- [ ] Optimize WASM bundle sizes
- [ ] Lazy loading for WASM modules
- [ ] Worker threads for WASM processing
- [ ] Memory management improvements

## Phase 4: Development Experience (Priority: MEDIUM)

### 4.1 Tooling Modernization
- [ ] ESLint flat config migration
- [ ] TypeScript project references
- [ ] Enhanced hot reload
- [ ] Better error boundaries

### 4.2 Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Test workspace organization
- [ ] Parallel test execution
- [ ] Component isolation testing
- [ ] E2E test optimization

## Phase 5: Production Architecture (Priority: MEDIUM)

### 5.1 Deployment Strategy
- [ ] Micro-frontend architecture
- [ ] Progressive loading
- [ ] Error tracking and monitoring
- [ ] Performance metrics

### 5.2 Security Hardening
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Content Security Policy
- [ ] Secure build pipeline
- [ ] Runtime security monitoring

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1-2: Dependency Cleanup
- Audit and remove unused packages
- Resolve version conflicts
- Optimize bundle configuration

### Week 3-4: Build Optimization
- Implement code splitting
- Add build caching
- Performance monitoring

### Week 5-8: Monorepo Migration
- Restructure to workspace format
- Migrate build configurations
- Test and validate

### Week 9-12: Production Readiness
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Monitoring implementation

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Build time < 30 seconds (currently ~17s)
- [ ] Bundle size < 1MB gzipped (currently 851KB)
- [ ] Memory usage < 2GB during build
- [ ] Development HMR < 500ms
- [ ] Zero dependency vulnerabilities

## Risk Mitigation
- Incremental migration approach
- Feature flags for new architecture
- Rollback strategies
- Comprehensive testing
