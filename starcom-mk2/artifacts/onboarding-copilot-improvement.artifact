# onboarding-copilot-improvement.artifact
# Purpose: Specification for improved onboarding output for AI agents and Copilot.
# Format: This file is a Markdown spec with a JSON schema example for onboarding output.

## Requirements
- Output must be a valid JSON object (no comments or mixed formats).
- Only list top-level folders and their immediate subfolders (not all files).
- Include a section for key artifacts and docs (top-level only).
- Add an `aiHints` section for fast agent navigation.
- Enforce a size limit (e.g., 50 lines or 4KB) in the onboarding script.
- Include a `version` and `generatedAt` field for change tracking.
- Provide a sample output schema below.

### Sample code-summary.json Output
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "structure": {
    "src": [
      "api", "assets", "cache", "components", "config", "context", "contracts", "data", "hooks", "interfaces", "layouts", "lib", "middleware", "models", "pages", "routes", "screens", "services", "store", "styles", "types", "utils", "views", "wasm", "windows", "workers"
    ],
    "scripts": ["deploy.ts", "onboard.cjs"],
    "docs": ["ONBOARDING.md", "README.md"],
    "public": ["starcom.ico", "starcom.png"],
    "rust": ["wasm-ephemeris", "wasm-mini-server", "fetch-test"]
  },
  "artifacts": ["starcom-mk2-repo-migration.artifact"],
  "aiHints": {
    "mainAppDir": "src",
    "contractsDir": "src/contracts",
    "docsDir": "docs",
    "entryPoints": ["src/App.tsx", "src/main.tsx"]
  },
  "generatedAt": "2025-06-11T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Implementation Notes
- The onboarding script should dynamically generate the above structure.
- If the output exceeds 50 lines or 4KB, fail with an error and suggest reducing detail.
- The `aiHints` section should be updated if entry points or key directories change.
- The `version` field should be incremented if the schema changes.
- This artifact should be referenced in onboarding and automation docs.

---

## Validation
- Ensure `cache/code-summary.json` is valid JSON and matches the schema above.
- Check that only top-level folders and immediate subfolders are listed.
- Confirm the output is under the enforced size limit.
- Validate presence of `aiHints`, `version`, and `generatedAt` fields.
