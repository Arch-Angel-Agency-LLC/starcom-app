# Globe Resize Stack Overflow Fix
**Date:** June 20, 2025  
**Issue:** Critical stack overflow in Globe.tsx handleResize function  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  

## 🚨 Problem: Infinite Recursion Stack Overflow

**Error Pattern:**
```
Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded.
    at handleResize (Globe.tsx:206:16)
    at handleResize (Globe.tsx:206:16)
    [repeated infinitely...]
```

**Root Cause:**
The `handleResize` function was creating an infinite recursion loop:
1. `handleResize()` dispatched a `resize` event to `window`
2. This triggered the `window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize)` listener  
3. Which called `handleResize()` again
4. Creating an endless loop causing stack overflow

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
function handleResize() {
  if (globeRef.current) {
    // ❌ This creates infinite recursion!
    const event = new Event('resize');
    window.dispatchEvent(event);
  }
}

window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize); // Listens for the event we dispatch!
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// AI-NOTE: Fix for stack overflow caused by recursive resize event dispatch
const debounceRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);

function handleResize() {
  // Clear any existing timeout to debounce resize calls
  if (debounceRef.current) {
    clearTimeout(debounceRef.current);
  }
  
  debounceRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
    // ✅ Access internal controls instead of dispatching events
    if (globeRef.current) {
      const globeInstance = globeRef.current as unknown as { controls?: { update: () => void } };
      if (globeInstance.controls && typeof globeInstance.controls.update === 'function') {
        globeInstance.controls.update();
      }
    }
  }, 100); // Debounce resize calls by 100ms
}
```

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Eliminated Infinite Recursion**
- Removed `window.dispatchEvent(event)` that caused the loop
- Now directly accesses globe's internal controls for updates

### 2. **Added Debouncing**
- Prevents excessive resize calls during window resizing
- 100ms debounce reduces performance impact
- Clears pending timeouts to avoid memory leaks

### 3. **Proper Cleanup**
- Cleanup function now clears pending debounced calls
- Prevents memory leaks when component unmounts

### 4. **Safe Globe Updates**
- Uses react-globe.gl's internal `controls.update()` method
- More reliable than dispatching synthetic events
- Maintains type safety with proper casting

## 🧪 Testing Results

- ✅ **Development Server**: Starts without errors
- ✅ **Browser Loading**: Globe renders without stack overflow
- ✅ **Window Resize**: Handled smoothly with debouncing
- ✅ **Safe Test Runner**: No infinite loops detected

## 🔍 Prevention Measures

**AI-NOTE for Future Development:**
- Never dispatch the same event type that a listener is registered for
- Always use debouncing for frequent events like resize
- Consider using RAF (requestAnimationFrame) for visual updates
- Test resize behavior during development

## 📝 Files Modified

- **`src/components/Globe/Globe.tsx`**: Fixed handleResize infinite recursion
  - Lines ~202-245: Resize handling logic
  - Added debounce mechanism with cleanup
  - Eliminated recursive event dispatching

## 🎉 Impact

**Critical Fix:** This resolves a showstopper bug that prevented the main Globe visualization from loading, which is the core feature of the Starcom application.

**Performance:** The debouncing also improves performance by reducing excessive resize calculations during window operations.

**Stability:** Eliminates random crashes and browser tab freezing caused by stack overflow.
