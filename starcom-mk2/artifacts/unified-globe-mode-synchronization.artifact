# Unified Globe Mode Synchronization Artifact

**Version:** 2.1  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-12  
**Maintainer:** Copilot

## Summary
This artifact documents the requirements, implementation steps, and verification for unifying globe mode switching in the Starcom App. Both the main 3D globe and TinyGlobe are now visually and functionally synchronized using a single source of truth (`VisualizationModeContext`).

## Requirements
- [x] Remove all local mode state from TinyGlobe; use only context
- [x] Implement canonical mapping function for mode translation
- [x] Refactor UI to use context-driven mode switching
- [x] Ensure both globes update instantly and consistently
- [x] Add/Update tests for all transitions, fallback, and UI
- [x] Enforce Vitest-only test environment; remove Jest
- [x] Document all changes and update artifacts

## Implementation Notes
- `TinyGlobe.tsx` now uses only `useVisualizationMode` and `setVisualizationMode` from context
- `modeMapping.ts` contains the canonical mapping function
- UI buttons in TinyGlobe call `setVisualizationMode` directly
- All local state and legacy mode logic removed from TinyGlobe
- Tests in `TinyGlobe.test.tsx` verify mode synchronization, UI, and fallback
- Vitest-only policy enforced; CSS module mocking and TypeScript config updated for compatibility

## Issues/Edge Cases
- No major issues encountered; minor TypeScript and CSS module mocking fixes required for Vitest
- All tests pass in a clean Vitest environment

## Verification
- Manual and automated tests confirm both globes update instantly and consistently for all mode transitions
- Fallback and warning logic verified for unknown modes

## AI-NOTE
All requirements are complete and verified as of 2025-06-12. This artifact is current and should be referenced for any future changes to globe mode logic, mapping, or test environment.
