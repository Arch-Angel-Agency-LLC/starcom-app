# Intelligence Exchange Market (IEM) â€” Implementation Status & Action Plan (Zero High-Risk Vulnerabilities)

## What Exists Already
- **Models:** `IntelReport` class (geolocation, metadata, tags, content) exists in `src/models/IntelReport.ts`.
- **Globe Engine:** Overlays for `intelMarkers` (SIGINT/HUMINT) are implemented as mocks in `GlobeEngine.ts` and mapped in `GlobeModeMapping.ts`.
- **UI/UX:** Extensive markdown documentation for intelligence overlays, metrics, dashboards, and tactical sidebars. UI logic for switching to intelligence overlays in TinyGlobe.
- **API:** Stub for intelligence data (`src/api/intelligence.ts`).
- **Routes:** `/intelreports` route exists but is not fully implemented.
- **Artifacts:** Plans, checklists, and audits are in place for Stage 1.

## What Still Needs Doing
- **Solana Integration:** Blockchain logic for minting, storing, or displaying Intel Reports as NFTs/tokens must use only `@solana/web3.js` (no SPL-Token JS, Metaplex, or other high-risk packages). Consider offloading minting to a secure backend or CLI if needed.
- **Live Data:** Connect overlays and models to real data sources (blockchain, APIs, backend).
- **UI Implementation:** Build out React components for dashboards, overlays, and intelligence report views (beyond markdown and stubs).
- **Testing:** Add tests for new Solana logic and UI components.
- **Artifact Completion:** Create missing artifacts for overlays, API, and integration logic.

## What Needs Refactor
- **EVM/Ethers.js Logic:** Replace or refactor all EVM/ethers.js-based hooks and components (e.g., `useOnChainRoles`, `useTokenGate`, `TokenGatedPage`) to use Solana primitives only.
- **Globe Overlays:** Refactor overlays to fetch and display live intelligence data, not just mocks.
- **API Layer:** Refactor `src/api/intelligence.ts` to connect to real smart contracts or backend.
- **Component Integration:** Refactor TinyGlobe and related UI to use real overlays and data.

## What Needs Deleting
- **Obsolete EVM/ethers.js Code:** Remove or archive any code, hooks, or components that are strictly for EVM/ethers.js and not reusable for Solana.
- **Unused Mocks:** Delete or replace mock overlays and data sources once live integrations are in place.
- **Redundant Docs:** Remove or update markdown docs that are superseded by real UI/components.
