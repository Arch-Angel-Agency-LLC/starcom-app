# Test Suite Migration Plan Artifact

## Purpose
Guide the migration from a centralized test directory to a modern, colocated, and maintainable test suite architecture. Designed for Copilot/AI automation and human review.

## Migration Table
| Old Path | New Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| src/__tests__/EIAService.test.ts | src/services/eia/EIAService.test.ts | Pending |  |
| src/__tests__/Web3Login.test.tsx | src/components/Web3Login/Web3Login.test.tsx | Pending |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Steps
1. Inventory all existing test files and their targets. Fill out the migration table above.
2. Move each test file next to the module it tests (see table).
3. Remove the centralized `src/__tests__` directory after migration.
4. Refactor imports and update test runner configs as needed.
5. Create or update shared test utilities in `src/test-utils/`.
6. Update documentation, onboarding scripts, and artifacts to reflect the new structure.
7. Validate migration: all tests pass, coverage is reported, and no test files remain in `src/__tests__`.
8. Rollback plan: If migration fails, restore from git and review migration table for issues.

## Ownership
- Copilot: Automate file moves, config updates, and artifact refresh.
- Human: Review edge cases, resolve ambiguous mappings, approve final migration.

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass in CI.
- No test files in `src/__tests__`.
- Coverage meets threshold.
- Artifacts and onboarding are up to date.
