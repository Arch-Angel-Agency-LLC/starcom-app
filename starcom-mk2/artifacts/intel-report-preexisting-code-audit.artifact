# Intelligence Exchange Market (IEM) â€” Pre-Existing Code Audit Results (Zero High-Risk Vulnerabilities)

## Purpose
This artifact documents all pre-existing code, modules, and logic related to "Intel" or the IEM prior to Stage 1 development. It serves as a reference for what is already implemented, what is stubbed or mocked, and what needs to be refactored or extended, with a focus on security.

## Pre-Existing Code Summary

### API
- `src/api/intelligence.ts`: Stub for querying intelligence data from smart contracts (no implementation).
- `src/api/market.mock.ts`: Mock market data including Solana, Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.

### Hooks
- `src/hooks/useOnChainRoles.ts`: Returns on-chain roles for a given address using EVM/ethers.js. TODO for real contract address. Not Solana-compatible.
- `src/hooks/useTokenGate.ts`: Checks if a user has the required balance of a token (NFT/ERC-20). EVM/ethers.js only.

### Interfaces
- `src/interfaces/Marketplace.ts`, `src/interfaces/MarketData.ts`: Define market data structures for use in the UI and state management.

### Components
- `src/components/Auth/TokenGatedPage.tsx`: Example of token/NFT-gated page using hooks above. EVM/ethers.js only.
- `src/components/HUD/Bars/BottomBar/BottomBar.md`: Describes UI/UX for deploying intel search, assigning investigators, and exporting reports.
- `src/components/HUD/Bars/LeftSideBar/LeftSideBar.md`: Describes tactical intelligence sidebar, active cases, global intel feed, AI-powered analyst, and command/control.
- `src/components/Globe/Globe.md`: Describes globe overlays for market, intelligence, and financial data.

### Globe Engine
- `src/globe-engine/GlobeEngine.ts`: Handles overlays for 'intelMarkers', market overlays, and other intelligence data. Overlays are currently stubbed/mocked.

### Store
- `src/store/store.md`: Zustand store for market data (example only).

### Routes
- `src/routes/routes.tsx`: Defines routes for `/intelreports` and token-gated pages.

### Artifacts
- See `artifacts/intel-report-code-audit-stage1.artifact` for full audit, and `artifacts/intel-report-stage1-plan.artifact` for next steps.

## Observations
- All pre-existing code is EVM/ethers.js-based, not Solana.
- Most intelligence and market overlays are mocked or described in markdown, not implemented in code.
- No real token/NFT minting, market exchange, or Solana integration exists yet.
- UI/UX for intelligence and market overlays is well-documented but not fully realized in code.
- All high-risk dependencies (Metaplex, SPL-Token JS, etc.) have been removed.

## Recommendations
- Refactor or replace EVM/ethers.js logic with Solana equivalents only, using only secure, minimal dependencies.
- Implement real overlays and data flows for intelligence and market data.
- Use this artifact as a reference for what to keep, refactor, or remove during Stage 1.
