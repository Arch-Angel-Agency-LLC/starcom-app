# Intelligence Exchange Market (IEM) Code Audit (Stage 1)

## Purpose
This artifact documents the current state of the Intelligence Exchange Market (IEM) and Intel Report system codebase, summarizes previous attempts, and identifies areas for improvement and next steps for Stage 1 development.

## Audit Scope
- Review all code, tests, and artifacts related to the IEM and Intel Report system (including token/NFT logic, UI, and integration points).
- Identify incomplete, deprecated, or experimental code.
- Note all TODOs and AI-NOTE comments relevant to the IEM and Intel Report system.
- Summarize current architecture and entry points.
- Reference previous attempts and lessons learned.

## Audit Checklist
- [x] List all relevant files and modules (TypeScript, Rust, scripts, tests, artifacts).
- [x] Summarize current implementation and gaps.
- [x] List all TODOs and AI-NOTE comments related to IEM/Intel Report.
- [x] Identify dependencies and integration points (Solana, Anchor, Metaplex, etc).
- [x] Recommend next steps for Stage 1.
- [ ] Link to plan and checklist artifacts for traceability.

## Relevant Files & Modules
- API: `src/api/intelligence.ts`, `src/api/market.mock.ts`
- Hooks: `src/hooks/useOnChainRoles.ts`, `src/hooks/useTokenGate.ts`
- Interfaces: `src/interfaces/Marketplace.ts`, `src/interfaces/MarketData.ts`
- Components: `src/components/Auth/TokenGatedPage.tsx`, `src/components/HUD/Bars/BottomBar/BottomBar.md`, `src/components/HUD/Bars/LeftSideBar/LeftSideBar.md`, `src/components/Globe/Globe.md`
- Globe Engine: `src/globe-engine/GlobeEngine.ts`, overlays for `intelMarkers`, market overlays
- Store: `src/store/store.md` (Zustand market store)
- Routes: `src/routes/routes.tsx`
- Artifacts: See `artifacts/intel-report-stage1-plan.artifact`, `artifacts/intel-report-stage1-checklist.artifact`, `artifacts/intel-report-artifact-index.artifact`

## Current Implementation & Gaps
- **Intel Report and IEM logic is partially implemented:**
  - Token/NFT gating and role-based access exist (see `useTokenGate`, `useOnChainRoles`, `TokenGatedPage`).
  - Market data mocks and interfaces are present, but no live Solana/Anchor/Metaplex integration yet.
  - Globe overlays for intelligence markers and market data are stubbed/mocked.
  - UI/UX for market and intelligence overlays is described in markdown docs, but not fully implemented in code.
- **Gaps:**
  - No Solana/Anchor/Metaplex contracts or client integration yet.
  - No real token/NFT minting or market exchange logic.
  - Some TODOs for contract addresses, overlays, and artifact-driven logic remain.

## TODOs & AI-NOTE Comments
- `useOnChainRoles.ts`: TODO for real contract address.
- `GlobeEngine.ts`: TODOs for initializing overlays, AI-NOTEs for artifact-driven overlays and API.
- Markdown docs and code reference artifact-driven overlays, but some artifacts are missing or incomplete.

## Dependencies & Integration Points
- Planned: Solana CLI, Anchor, Metaplex, @solana/web3.js, @solana/spl-token, @metaplex-foundation/js
- Current: ethers.js for EVM compatibility, Zustand for state, React/TypeScript for UI

## Previous Attempts & Lessons Learned
- Previous code attempts focused on EVM/ethers.js for token gating and roles, not Solana/Anchor.
- Market and intelligence overlays are mocked, not live.
- UI/UX is well-documented in markdown, but code is incomplete.
- Next attempt should focus on Solana/Anchor/Metaplex integration and artifact-driven overlays.

## Next Steps (Stage 1)
- Implement Solana/Anchor/Metaplex integration for token/NFT minting and market logic.
- Replace mocks with live data and overlays.
- Complete missing artifacts for overlays and API.
- Link this audit to the plan and checklist artifacts for traceability.
- Update this artifact as the codebase evolves.
