# Intelligence Exchange Market (IEM) Code Audit (Stage 1, Serverless, Zero High-Risk Vulnerabilities)

## Purpose
This artifact documents the current state of the Intelligence Exchange Market (IEM) and Intel Report system codebase, summarizes previous attempts, and identifies areas for improvement and next steps for Stage 1 development, with a focus on zero high-risk vulnerabilities and a fully serverless, on-chain architecture.

## Security-Driven Changes
- All high-risk dependencies (Metaplex, SPL-Token JS, etc.) have been removed.
- SPL token and NFT logic must use only `@solana/web3.js` and on-chain programs.
- All future blockchain logic must avoid high-risk or deprecated packages.
- No backend, CLI, or server is used; all logic is on-chain or in the client.

## Gaps
- No SPL-Token JS or Metaplex logic allowed; only minimal, custom, or on-chain minting.
- Some TODOs for overlays, artifact-driven logic, and metadata remain.

## Dependencies & Integration Points
- Allowed: Solana CLI (for local dev), Anchor, @solana/web3.js
- Disallowed: Metaplex, SPL-Token JS, deprecated or high-risk packages, any backend/server

## Next Steps (Stage 1)
- Implement Solana integration for token/NFT minting and market logic using only secure, on-chain approaches.
- Replace mocks with live data and overlays, all fetched on-chain.
- Complete missing artifacts for overlays and API.
- Link this audit to the plan and checklist artifacts for traceability.
- Update this artifact as the codebase evolves.
