## Purpose
High-level design, requirements, and architecture for the unified web3 login system.

---

### Goals
- Provide seamless, secure, and user-friendly web3 wallet login (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- Support multiple EVM chains and network switching
- Modular, extensible, and artifact-driven implementation
- Clear error handling and user feedback

---

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to connect my wallet and see my address and network.
- As a user, I want to disconnect my wallet at any time.
- As a user, I must accept terms before connecting my wallet.
- As a developer/agent, I want all login logic to be modular and testable.

---

### Architecture
- React Context for authentication state
- Hooks for wallet logic
- UI components for status, modals, and errors
- Middleware for wallet-required actions
- 100% decentralized: No backend for authentication/session. All auth/session logic is client-side (wallet signatures, SIWE, localStorage) or on-chain (role checks, token gating).
- See docs/Decentralized Web3 dApp Development Guide.markdown for best practices and code patterns.

### Authentication & Session Management (Decentralized)
- Use wallet connection and client-side signature verification (e.g., SIWE) for authentication.
- Persist sessions in localStorage with expiry, never on a server.
- Use on-chain data for authorization and access control.

### Backend Auth Flow (REMOVED)
This section intentionally left blank to document removal of backend auth/session flows for decentralization.

---

### Dependencies
- ethers.js, wagmi, RainbowKit/Web3Modal (for wallet modal)
- React Context, React Router

---

### Security
- Validate network and address
- (Optional) Signature-based authentication for backend/session

---

### Diagram
- [TODO: Add system architecture diagram here, including backend auth flow.]

---

### AI-NOTE
- If you change the architecture or dependencies, update this artifact and reference the change in the changelog.

---

### Update Protocol
- Update this artifact for any major design or architectural change.
- Add a `TODO:` if you are unsure about a design decision.
- Reference the changelog artifact for all updates.
