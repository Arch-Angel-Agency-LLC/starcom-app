# Intelligence Exchange Market (IEM) â€” Deep Code Audit Results (Intel-Related, Zero High-Risk Vulnerabilities)

## Purpose
This artifact provides a comprehensive, deep audit of all code, documentation, and artifacts related to "Intel" or intelligence features in the codebase, including models, overlays, UI, and planned integrations. It is intended to inform Stage 1 and future development, with a focus on security and minimal dependencies.

## Key Findings
- All high-risk dependencies (Metaplex, SPL-Token JS, etc.) have been removed.
- SPL token and NFT logic must use only `@solana/web3.js` or secure backend/CLI.
- All future blockchain logic must avoid high-risk or deprecated packages.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize connecting `IntelReport` model and overlays to real data sources and blockchain contracts using only secure, minimal dependencies.
- Implement Solana logic for minting, storing, and displaying intelligence reports as NFTs (no Metaplex, no SPL-Token JS).
- Use this audit as a reference for all future work involving intelligence features.
