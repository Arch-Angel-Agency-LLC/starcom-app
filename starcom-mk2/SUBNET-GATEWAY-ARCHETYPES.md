## 🎯 **MVP: MINIMUM VIABLE SUBNET/GATEWAY IMPLEMENTATION**

### **MVP Philosophy: Mission-First Simplicity**

After analyzing all archetypes, the MVP should focus on **immediate Earth Alliance operational needs** rather than comprehensive networking features. Start with what teams actually need today, not theoretical enterprise requirements.

### **MVP Core Components**

#### **1. Enhanced Team Isolation (Team Subnets)**
**Why MVP**: Teams need secure communication channels immediately.

**Implementation**:
```rust
// Extend existing TeamConfig in ai-security-relaynode
pub struct TeamSubnetConfig {
    // Existing fields
    team_id: String,
    team_name: String,
    security_level: SecurityLevel,
    
    // MVP additions
    subnet_mode: SubnetMode,
    trusted_teams: Vec<String>,        // Teams we can bridge to
    bridge_permissions: BridgePermissions,
}

pub enum SubnetMode {
    Isolated,           // No cross-team communication
    Bridged,           // Can communicate with trusted teams
    Regional,          // Geographic coordination mode
}
```

**dApp Integration**:
```typescript
// Extend RelayNodeIPFSService for subnet awareness
export class RelayNodeIPFSService {
  async setSubnetMode(mode: 'isolated' | 'bridged' | 'regional'): Promise<void> {
    // Configure RelayNode for subnet operation
  }
  
  async requestTeamBridge(targetTeamId: string): Promise<BridgeRequest> {
    // Request access to another team's subnet
  }
  
  async shareIntelWithTeam(intel: IntelPackage, targetTeamId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Share intelligence across team boundary
  }
}
```

#### **2. Simple Security Gateway**
**Why MVP**: Protection against infiltration is essential.

**Implementation**:
```rust
pub struct SecurityGateway {
    // Essential security functions only
    access_control: TeamAccessControl,
    content_filter: BasicContentFilter,
    audit_logger: AuditLogger,
}

impl SecurityGateway {
    pub async fn verify_team_member(&self, user_id: &str, team_id: &str) -> bool {
        // Basic cryptographic identity verification
    }
    
    pub async fn scan_content(&self, content: &[u8]) -> ScanResult {
        // Basic malware/threat detection
    }
    
    pub async fn log_access_attempt(&self, attempt: &AccessAttempt) {
        // Essential audit logging
    }
}
```

#### **3. Bridge Discovery Protocol**
**Why MVP**: Teams need to find each other for collaboration.

**Implementation**:
```rust
// Extend ai-security-relaynode/src/nostr_relay.rs
impl NostrRelay {
    pub async fn handle_bridge_discovery(&self, event: &NostrEvent) {
        match event.kind {
            10001 => self.process_team_announcement(event).await,
            10002 => self.process_bridge_request(event).await,
            10003 => self.process_bridge_response(event).await,
            _ => self.handle_standard_event(event).await,
        }
    }
}
```

**dApp Integration**:

    pending_requests: Vec<BridgeRequest>,
    security_gateway: Arc<SecurityGateway>,
}
```

**Cross-Team Communication**:
- Encrypted bridge channels
- Temporary bridge tokens
- Automatic bridge expiration

#### **5. Intelligence Sharing Protocol**
**Why MVP**: Share evidence and intelligence across team boundaries.

**IPFS Integration**:
```typescript
// Enhanced src/services/RelayNodeIPFSService.ts
export class RelayNodeIPFSService {
  async shareIntelWithTeam(
    intel: IntelPackage, 
    targetTeamId: string,
    permissions: SharingPermissions
  ): Promise<CrossTeamShare> {
    // Encrypt intel for target team
    // Create bridge-specific IPFS hash
