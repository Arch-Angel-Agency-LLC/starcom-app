The JSON file tertiary_ace_epam_5m.json contains solar particle and radiation environment data collected by the ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer) EPAM (Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor) instrument. This dataset is used for space weather monitoring and radiation storm forecasting.

Breakdown of Key Fields
	1.	time_tag â€“ Timestamp (UTC) of the recorded measurement.
	2.	de1, de4 â€“ Differential Electron Flux at different energy levels (MeV).
	3.	p1, p3, p5, p7 â€“ Proton flux at different energy ranges.
	4.	fp6p â€“ High-energy proton flux.
	5.	p1_30, p2_30, p3_30 â€“ 30-minute averaged proton flux data.
	6.	numpts_* â€“ Number of valid data points for each parameter.
	7.	dsflag_* â€“ Data status flag (indicating data validity).

Purpose of This Data
	â€¢	Radiation Storm Forecasting:
	â€¢	Sudden increases in proton flux indicate potential solar radiation storms.
	â€¢	Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) Detection:
	â€¢	Elevated high-energy proton levels suggest CME shockwaves approaching Earth.
	â€¢	Astronaut & Spacecraft Safety:
	â€¢	Monitors radiation levels for ISS, satellites, and deep-space missions.
	â€¢	Geomagnetic Storm Warnings:
	â€¢	High-energy protons contribute to magnetospheric disturbances affecting power grids, GPS, and communication networks.
	â€¢	Solar Cycle Studies:
	â€¢	Tracks variations in solar energetic particles (SEPs) over time.

Understanding EPAM Data

Parameter	Normal Range	High Impact Levels	Effects
Electron Flux (de1, de4)	Low (< 1e-10)	High (> 1e-5)	Can indicate solar flares
Proton Flux (p1, p3, p5, p7)	Low (< 1000)	High (> 10,000)	Increased radiation risk for spacecraft
High-Energy Proton Flux (fp6p)	Low (< 1e-12)	High (> 1e-8)	Can indicate a strong solar event

ðŸ”¹ Current flux levels indicate stable conditions with no major solar storm activity detected.
ðŸ”¸ Any rapid increase in high-energy protons (fp6p) could indicate an approaching CME.
