The JSON file tertiary_differential_electrons_1d.json contains differential electron flux data recorded by NOAA’s GOES-16 satellite. This dataset provides electron flux measurements at various energy levels, which are crucial for understanding space weather conditions, geomagnetic storms, and their impact on Earth’s magnetosphere.

Breakdown of Key Fields
	1.	time_tag – Timestamp (UTC) of the recorded measurement.
	2.	satellite – Identifier for the NOAA satellite (GOES-16 in this dataset).
	3.	flux – Measured electron flux (in particles per cm²·s·sr).
	4.	energy – Energy range of the detected electrons (e.g., “1000-1900 keV”, “80-115 keV”).

Purpose of This Data
	•	Space Weather Monitoring:
	•	Helps track high-energy electron flux levels, which can indicate solar storms or geomagnetic disturbances.
	•	Satellite & Spacecraft Protection:
	•	Excessive electron flux can cause charging issues and damage electronics on satellites.
	•	Geomagnetic Storm Forecasting:
	•	Sudden increases in electron flux often precede geomagnetic storms.
	•	Radiation Hazard Warnings:
	•	High-energy electron levels can pose radiation risks to astronauts and high-altitude flights.
	•	Magnetosphere Behavior Studies:
	•	Used to analyze electron dynamics in Earth’s radiation belts (Van Allen belts).

Understanding Electron Flux Levels

Electron Energy Range	Impact
80-115 keV	Background levels, minimal space weather effects
115-165 keV	Early signs of increased activity
700-1000 keV	Moderate geomagnetic activity possible
1000-1900 keV	High-energy electrons, potential for satellite anomalies
3200-6500 keV	Extremely high energy, may indicate a strong space weather event

	•	High flux values (> 10,000 particles/cm²·s·sr) indicate strong solar activity, which may lead to geomagnetic storms.
	•	Low values suggest normal quiet space weather conditions.

How This Data Is Used
	•	NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC): Issues alerts for geomagnetic storms and space radiation.
	•	NASA & ESA Missions: Helps protect satellites and space probes from energetic particles.
	•	Aviation & Military Operations: Ensures safe communication and navigation systems.
	•	Geophysics & Research Institutes: Studies electron behavior in Earth’s radiation belts.
