The JSON file primary_solar_protons.json contains solar proton flux data from NOAA, specifically from the GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) system. This data is essential for monitoring solar energetic particle (SEP) events, which are associated with solar storms and space weather hazards.

Breakdown of Key Fields:
	1.	time_tag – The timestamp (UTC) when the measurement was taken.
	2.	satellite – The identifier of the NOAA satellite that collected the data (e.g., GOES-18).
	3.	flux – The proton flux measured in particles per cm² per second per steradian.
	4.	energy – The energy threshold for the recorded protons, including:
	•	>=1 MeV (low-energy solar protons)
	•	>=5 MeV, >=10 MeV, >=30 MeV, >=50 MeV, >=60 MeV, >=100 MeV, >=500 MeV (progressively higher-energy particles).

Purpose of This Data:
	•	Space Weather Monitoring: Tracks increases in solar proton flux, which can indicate solar flares or coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
	•	Radiation Hazard Assessment: High-energy protons pose a radiation hazard for astronauts, satellites, and high-altitude aviation.
	•	Impact on Earth’s Magnetosphere: Large solar proton events can trigger geomagnetic storms and enhance auroral activity.
	•	Communication & Navigation Disruptions: High-energy protons can cause HF (high-frequency) radio blackouts and GPS errors.

How This Data Is Used:
	•	Satellite & Spacecraft Operators: Monitor space weather risks for satellite damage and electronic malfunctions.
	•	Aviation Safety: Used by airlines to assess radiation exposure risks for high-altitude polar flights.
	•	Aurora Prediction: High proton flux can lead to enhanced auroral activity at high latitudes.
	•	NOAA & NASA Space Weather Forecasting: Helps predict the potential impact of solar storms on Earth’s magnetic field and power grids.
