The JSON file secondary_solar_wind_speed.json contains solar wind data collected from NOAA or NASA space weather monitoring satellites. It primarily provides solar wind speed measurements and related parameters that are crucial for space weather forecasting and geomagnetic activity monitoring.

Breakdown of Key Fields:
	1.	time_tag – The timestamp (UTC) of the recorded measurement.
	2.	bt – The total magnetic field strength (in nanoteslas).
	3.	bx_gse, by_gse, bz_gse – Components of the magnetic field in the Geocentric Solar Ecliptic (GSE) coordinate system.
	4.	theta_gse, phi_gse – Angles of the solar wind magnetic field in the GSE system.
	5.	bx_gsm, by_gsm, bz_gsm – Magnetic field components in the Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric (GSM) coordinate system.
	6.	theta_gsm, phi_gsm – Angles of the solar wind magnetic field in the GSM system.

Purpose of This Data:
	•	Monitoring Solar Wind Speed & Direction:
	•	Helps predict geomagnetic storms and disturbances caused by solar activity.
	•	Predicting Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) Impacts:
	•	Sudden increases in solar wind speed and magnetic field fluctuations can indicate an incoming CME shockwave.
	•	Understanding Magnetosphere Reactions:
	•	Changes in Bz (GSM) values are crucial in determining the likelihood of geomagnetic storms.
	•	Satellite & Power Grid Protection:
	•	High-speed solar winds can disrupt satellites, GPS systems, and power grids.
	•	Aurora Forecasting:
	•	Strong solar wind activity enhances aurora borealis and aurora australis visibility.

Understanding Solar Wind Conditions:

Parameter	Normal Range	High Impact Levels	Effects
Solar Wind Speed (km/s)	300 - 500	> 700	Increased risk of geomagnetic storms
Magnetic Field Strength (nT)	5 - 10	> 20	High impact on Earth’s magnetosphere
Bz (GSM) Component (nT)	-5 to +5	< -10	Southward orientation increases storm potential

Recent Data Observations:

The file contains real-time solar wind parameters, recorded every second. A quick analysis suggests:
	•	Solar wind speed is relatively stable (~300-350 km/s).
	•	Magnetic field variations show minor fluctuations, indicating no major storm activity at the moment.
	•	No significant southward Bz deviations, suggesting low geomagnetic storm risk.

How This Data Is Used:
	•	NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC): Provides space weather alerts.
	•	NASA & ESA Missions: Used for studying solar-terrestrial interactions.
	•	Power Grid & Satellite Operators: Helps mitigate geomagnetic storm impacts.
	•	Aurora Watchers & Astronomers: Determines aurora visibility conditions.
