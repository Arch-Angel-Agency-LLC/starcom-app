The JSON file secondary_integral_electron_flux.json contains integral electron flux data from NOAA, recorded by the GOES-16 satellite. This dataset tracks the flux of high-energy electrons (≥2 MeV), which are important for understanding space weather conditions and their effects on satellites.

Breakdown of Key Fields:
	1.	energy – The minimum energy threshold for the recorded electrons (≥2 MeV).
	2.	instrument – The type of instrument measuring the data (electrons).
	3.	satellite – The identifier of the NOAA GOES satellite collecting the data (GOES-16).
	4.	time_tag – The timestamp (UTC) when the measurement was recorded.
	5.	fluence – The electron fluence, which represents the total number of high-energy electrons detected over a given time period.

Purpose of This Data:
	•	Monitoring Space Weather: Electron flux levels help track geomagnetic storms, solar storms, and radiation belts.
	•	Satellite Protection: High-energy electrons can penetrate spacecraft shielding and cause charging events that may damage or disrupt satellites.
	•	Predicting Geomagnetic Activity: Increases in electron flux often correlate with solar wind disturbances and geomagnetic storms.
	•	Understanding the Van Allen Belts: The data contributes to studies of the Earth’s radiation belts, which trap energetic particles.

Understanding Electron Fluence Levels:
	•	Higher fluence values indicate a stronger presence of high-energy electrons, often linked to space weather events such as solar storms and geomagnetic disturbances.
	•	Sharp increases in fluence may signal enhanced radiation hazards for satellites and astronauts.

Recent Data Observations:

Date (UTC)	Electron Fluence (≥2 MeV)
2025-02-17	94,736,129
2025-02-18	49,079,726
2025-02-19	12,248,166
2025-02-20	9,196,214
2025-02-21	15,493,366
2025-02-22	9,906,822

	•	Feb 17 shows the highest fluence, suggesting significant electron activity.
	•	A sharp drop occurred after Feb 18, possibly indicating a return to quieter space weather conditions.

How This Data Is Used:
	•	Space Agencies (NOAA, NASA): Used for radiation environment monitoring and satellite operations.
	•	Satellite Operators: Helps predict and mitigate satellite damage from electron storms.
	•	Space Weather Forecasters: Tracks trends in solar activity affecting Earth’s magnetosphere.
	•	Astronaut Safety: Important for assessing radiation exposure risks for crewed space missions.
