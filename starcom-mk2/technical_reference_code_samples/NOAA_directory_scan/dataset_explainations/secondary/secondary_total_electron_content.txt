The JSON file secondary_total_electron_content.json contains data related to Total Electron Content (TEC) in Earth’s ionosphere. TEC is a critical measurement used in space weather monitoring, GPS accuracy assessment, and ionospheric studies.

Breakdown of Key Fields (Expected Data)
	1.	time_tag – Timestamp (UTC) of the recorded measurement.
	2.	tec – Total Electron Content, measured in TECU (Total Electron Content Units).
	3.	latitude / longitude – Geographic coordinates of the measurement.
	4.	altitude – The altitude level where TEC is being measured.
	5.	satellite_id – The identifier of the satellite collecting the data.

Purpose of This Data
	•	GPS Accuracy Monitoring:
	•	TEC affects GPS signal delay—higher TEC values lead to signal distortion and positioning errors.
	•	Ionospheric Studies:
	•	Scientists use TEC data to study ionospheric disturbances, solar activity, and geomagnetic storms.
	•	Space Weather Forecasting:
	•	Sudden TEC fluctuations can indicate solar storms, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), or ionospheric storms.
	•	HF Radio Communications:
	•	Changes in TEC impact high-frequency (HF) radio wave propagation, affecting military, aviation, and emergency communication networks.

Understanding Total Electron Content (TEC)

TEC Level (TECU)	Impact
0-10 TECU	Quiet ionospheric conditions, minimal GPS errors
10-50 TECU	Normal variations, slight GPS deviations
50-100 TECU	Disturbed ionosphere, noticeable GPS errors
>100 TECU	Strong ionospheric storm, severe GPS disruptions

	•	High TEC values indicate increased solar activity, which can disrupt GPS and communication systems.
	•	Low TEC values suggest calm space weather conditions.

How This Data Is Used
	•	Space Weather Agencies (NOAA, NASA, ESA): Used for forecasting ionospheric disturbances.
	•	Aviation & Military Sectors: Ensures reliable GPS and HF radio communications.
	•	Telecommunications Industry: Helps predict and mitigate satellite communication disruptions.
	•	Geophysics & Climate Research: Studies ionospheric trends related to solar cycles.
