📌 Left-Side: The Tactical Intelligence Sidebar (Packed, But Functional)

Left Sidebar (Command Panel): Operations, AI analysis, investigations, strategic deployments

Since RTS games don’t normally overload the left side, we must innovate a collapsible, multi-layered system that maximizes usability.

🔳 Innovative “Stacked Sidebar” Approach

Instead of cluttering the sidebar with tons of tabs, we use a stackable, vertical carousel:
	•	Primary Sidebar (Always Visible): Quick-access panels.
	•	Sub-Panels (Expands on Hover/Click): Opens overlays when needed.

Primary Sidebar Sections (Quick-Access Intelligence Menu)

📌 1. Active Cases Dashboard
	•	List of ongoing investigations & key findings.
	•	Click a case to expand detailed intel reports.
	•	“Pin” key cases for instant recall.

📌 2. Global Intel Feed (Live OSINT Timeline)
	•	Real-time updates from news, social media, threat reports.
	•	Color-coded based on credibility rating (Verified, Unverified, Threat, Critical).
	•	Click items to attach them to an investigation.

📌 3. AI-Powered Analyst (Your Tactical Advisor)
	•	Automated briefings, threat alerts, and OSINT pattern recognition.
	•	Suggests intelligence correlations (e.g., “This trend matches previous cyberattack patterns”).
	•	AI-generated risk assessments for ongoing cases.

📌 4. Command & Control (Agent & Bot Assignments)
	•	Deploy human investigators, AI agents, or automated web scrapers.
	•	Assign tasks like “Deep Scan” or “Social Network Analysis.”
	•	Shows status reports (e.g., “Bot 3 is analyzing dark web data”).

📌 5. Secure Communications (Ops Team Chat & Coordination)
	•	Real-time chat with team members or AI agents.
	•	Secure document/file sharing within cases.

📌 6. Strategic Tools & Utilities (Extra Investigative Functions)
	•	Digital Forensics Toolkit.
	•	OSINT Browser Integration.
	•	Encrypted Notes & Bookmarks.

📌 7. Customizable Widgets (User Preference Area)
	•	Users can add custom data feeds, preferred tools, or shortcuts.
