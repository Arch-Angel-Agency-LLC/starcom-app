ðŸ“‚ Screens/ (Large UI Containers with Business Logic)
	â€¢	What it is:
	â€¢	Screens exist within Pages and represent major sections of a Page.
	â€¢	Usually contain multiple components, data fetching, and UI logic.
	â€¢	When to use:
	â€¢	When the UI needs context-aware logic, such as data fetching, state management, and UI composition.
	â€¢	Screens can contain Windows & Components but should not contain route logic.

ðŸ“Œ Note:
	â€¢	Pages are major sections like MainPage, SettingsPage, etc.
	â€¢	Screens are interactive overlays, menus, dashboards, and HUD elements found within these pages.
	â€¢	Screens can stack dynamically, meaning users can have multiple screens open at once for maximum multitasking (like Stellarisâ€™ layered UI).
