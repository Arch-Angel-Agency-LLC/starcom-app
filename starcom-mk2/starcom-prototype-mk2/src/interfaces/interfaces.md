Interfaces - TypeScript Data Definitions

🔹 What it is:
	•	Stores TypeScript types & interfaces for props, API responses, and state.
	•	Keeps data structures organized and avoids type duplication.

🔹 How it connects:
✅ Screens, Views, and Components import these interfaces for type safety.
✅ Interfaces create a contract between the UI and API data.
