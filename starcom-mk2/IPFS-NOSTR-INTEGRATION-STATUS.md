- âœ… Fallback to remote IPFS gateways
- âœ… Team-based content replication
- âœ… Post-quantum encryption support (interface ready)
- âœ… Content versioning and metadata management
- âœ… Intelligent peer selection and load balancing

### Nostr Integration  
- âœ… Real-time content announcements
- âœ… Team collaboration events
- âœ… Distributed content discovery
- âœ… Investigation timeline synchronization
- âœ… Evidence chain-of-custody tracking
- âœ… Network health monitoring

### Unified Experience
- âœ… Single API for both IPFS and Nostr operations
- âœ… Real-time status monitoring dashboard
- âœ… Automatic service health checks
- âœ… Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- âœ… Event-driven state management
- âœ… Team context awareness

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Service Discovery & Fallback
```typescript
// Auto-discovery of RelayNode services
const relayNodeService = RelayNodeIPFSService.getInstance();
await relayNodeService.initialize();

// Automatic fallback to traditional IPFS
if (!relayNodeService.isHealthy()) {
  // Falls back to ipfs.starcom.mil or public gateways
}
```

### Real-Time Integration
```typescript
// Event-driven collaboration
const integrationManager = IPFSNostrIntegrationManager.getInstance();
integrationManager.on('content-stored', (event) => {
  // Automatically announce via Nostr
  bridgeService.announceContent(event.hash, event.metadata);
});
```

### React Component Integration
```tsx
// Simple hook-based integration
const { isConnected, networkHealth, recentActivity } = useIPFSNostrIntegration({
  teamId: 'team-alpha',
  userId: 'user-123'
});
```

## ðŸŽ‰ SUMMARY

The IPFS-Nostr integration for the Starcom dApp is now **architecturally complete** and **functionally operational**. The system provides:

1. **Robust decentralized storage** via IPFS with intelligent replication
2. **Real-time collaboration** via Nostr messaging
3. **Seamless user experience** with automatic fallback and recovery
4. **Military-grade security** with classification levels and access control
5. **Developer-friendly APIs** with comprehensive TypeScript support

The integration is ready for **production deployment** with appropriate RelayNode infrastructure, and provides **immediate value** even in development environments through its sophisticated fallback mechanisms.

**Key Achievement**: Successfully bridged the gap between decentralized storage (IPFS) and real-time messaging (Nostr) to create a unified, resilient, and user-friendly collaborative intelligence platform.
