## 🔐 Security Model

### Post-Quantum Cryptography
```rust
// Example: Quantum-safe encryption
use pqcrypto_kyber::kyber1024;
use pqcrypto_dilithium::dilithium5;

// Key encapsulation
let (pk, sk) = kyber1024::keypair();
let (ss, ct) = kyber1024::encapsulate(&pk);

// Digital signatures  
let (pk, sk) = dilithium5::keypair();
let sig = dilithium5::sign(message, &sk);
```
