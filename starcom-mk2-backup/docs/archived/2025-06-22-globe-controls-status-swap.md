**Date:** June 22, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## Overview

Successfully swapped the Globe Controls and Globe Status components between the LeftSideBar and RightSideBar as requested.

## Changes Made

### üìÅ New Components Created

1. **`src/components/HUD/Bars/LeftSideBar/GlobeControls.tsx`**
   - Moved from RightSideBar's renderGlobeControls function
   - Contains overlay toggles and quick action buttons
   - Styled for compact LeftSideBar layout

2. **`src/components/HUD/Bars/LeftSideBar/GlobeControls.module.css`**
   - Compact styling optimized for 110px LeftSideBar width
   - Maintains visual consistency with existing sidebar components

3. **`src/components/HUD/Bars/RightSideBar/GlobeStatus.tsx`**
   - Moved from LeftSideBar's mission status functionality
   - Shows current globe state, visualization mode, and system health
   - Displays focus location and active overlays count

4. **`src/components/HUD/Bars/RightSideBar/GlobeStatus.module.css`**
   - Status display styling with health indicators
   - Real-time pulse animations for system health dots

5. **`src/hooks/useOverlayData.ts`**
   - Shared hook for overlay data between both sidebars
   - Provides real-time simulation of globe overlay statistics
   - 30-second update intervals

### üîÑ Modified Components

1. **`src/components/HUD/Bars/LeftSideBar/LeftSideBar.tsx`**
   - Added GlobeControls component after TinyGlobe
   - Integrated useOverlayData hook
   - Maintains existing TinyGlobe and ModeSettingsPanel

2. **`src/components/HUD/Bars/RightSideBar/RightSideBar.tsx`**
   - Replaced renderMissionStatus with renderGlobeStatus
   - Removed old renderGlobeControls function
   - Updated navigation button labels and icons
   - Cleaned up unused imports
   - Updated section navigation to reflect new content

## Functional Changes

### LeftSideBar (Now Contains)
- ‚úÖ Wing Commander Logo & Starcom branding
- ‚úÖ TinyGlobe (3D globe visualization with mode buttons)
- ‚úÖ **Globe Controls** (NEW - overlay toggles, quick actions)
- ‚úÖ Mode Settings Panel (dynamic settings for current mode)

### RightSideBar (Now Contains)
- ‚úÖ **Globe Status** (NEW - mode, focus, system health)
- ‚úÖ Intelligence Hub (moved to control section)
- ‚úÖ Live Metrics Dashboard
- ‚úÖ AI Actions Panel
- ‚úÖ Collaboration Tools
- ‚úÖ External Apps
- ‚úÖ Developer Tools

## Navigation Updates

### Updated Button Labels & Icons
- **Mission section (üì°):** "Globe Status" (was "Mission Status")
- **Control section (üìä):** "Intelligence Hub" (was "Globe Controls")

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Logical Organization:** Globe Controls are now co-located with the TinyGlobe that they control
2. **Status Visibility:** Globe Status is now prominently displayed in the mission control area
3. **Improved Workflow:** Users can control globe overlays directly from the left while monitoring status on the right
4. **Consistent Architecture:** Maintains the left-side controls / right-side status pattern
5. **Clean Integration:** All components compile without errors and maintain existing functionality

## Testing Results

- ‚úÖ Build completes successfully (`npm run build`)
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ‚úÖ No ESLint violations
- ‚úÖ All imports properly resolved
- ‚úÖ Styling maintains consistency with existing design system

## Technical Notes

- **Data Sharing:** Both components use the shared `useOverlayData` hook for consistent state
- **Performance:** Components are lightweight and maintain real-time updates
- **Accessibility:** Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML maintained
- **Responsive:** Components adapt to collapsed sidebar states

## Architecture Impact

This change improves the logical flow of the HUD system:
- **Left Side:** Primary controls and configuration (TinyGlobe + Globe Controls + Settings)
- **Right Side:** Status monitoring and mission management (Globe Status + Intel + Metrics)

The swap aligns with the established pattern where the left sidebar provides operational controls while the right sidebar offers status monitoring and secondary tools.

---

**AI-NOTE:** Successfully completed sidebar content reorganization per user requirements. Globe Controls now logically grouped with TinyGlobe in LeftSideBar, while Globe Status provides mission-critical information in RightSideBar mission control area.
