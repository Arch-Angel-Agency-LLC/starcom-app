The JSON file primary_solar_radiation_xray_7d.json contains solar X-ray flux data from NOAA, likely from the GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) system. This dataset is used for monitoring solar X-ray emissions, which are a crucial component of space weather forecasting.

Breakdown of Key Fields:
	1.	time_tag – The timestamp in UTC, indicating when the measurement was taken.
	2.	satellite – The identifier of the GOES satellite collecting the data (e.g., GOES-16).
	3.	flux – The measured X-ray flux, given in watts per square meter (W/m²).
	4.	observed_flux – The recorded flux level, possibly with additional corrections.
	5.	electron_correction – Adjustments applied to the data to correct for electron contamination.
	6.	electron_contaminaton – A Boolean flag (true or false) indicating whether electron contamination was detected.
	7.	energy – The wavelength range of the X-ray flux measurement, categorized as:
	•	0.05-0.4 nm (soft X-rays)
	•	0.1-0.8 nm (hard X-rays)

Purpose of This Data:
	•	Monitoring Solar Flares: X-ray flux is a key indicator of solar flares, which can affect Earth’s ionosphere, GPS, and radio communications.
	•	Space Weather Prediction: Helps forecast geomagnetic storms and potential solar radiation hazards.
	•	Radiation Hazard Assessment: Used to protect astronauts, satellites, and high-altitude flights from excessive radiation exposure.
	•	Aurora Forecasting: X-ray emissions from the Sun can influence auroral activity and geomagnetic disturbances.

Understanding X-ray Flux Levels:

X-ray flux is classified into five levels:

X-ray Class	Flux Range (W/m²)	Effect
A-Class	< 10⁻⁷	Minimal impact
B-Class	10⁻⁷ – 10⁻⁶	Small disturbances
C-Class	10⁻⁶ – 10⁻⁵	Minor radio blackouts
M-Class	10⁻⁵ – 10⁻⁴	Moderate radio blackouts
X-Class	> 10⁻⁴	Strong radio blackouts, GPS errors, power grid risks

How This Data Is Used:
	•	NOAA and NASA use it for space weather alerts.
	•	Airlines and power grid operators monitor it to protect aviation communication and electrical infrastructure.
	•	Amateur radio operators track solar activity to adjust radio frequencies.
