# Emergency Deployment Action Plan: Jetson Nano Cyber Investigation Platform

**Date:** June 26, 2025  
**Mission:** Deploy functional AI Security RelayNode on Jetson Nano for 3-12 person cyber investigation team  
**Timeline:** 4 weeks to operational status  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Transnational crime syndicate investigation  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Objective:** Transform the current development platform into a production-ready cyber investigation suite deployable on Jetson Nano within 4 weeks.

**Critical Path:** Architecture Fix â†’ Authentication â†’ Jetson Deployment â†’ Investigation Workflow â†’ Security Hardening

**Success Criteria:** 
- Team can securely authenticate and join investigation
- Evidence can be collected and cryptographically secured
- Structured investigation workflow operational
- Platform runs reliably on Jetson Nano hardware

## ðŸ“‹ **PHASE 1: ARCHITECTURAL EMERGENCY (WEEK 1)**

### **Priority 1A: Fix Production Architecture Coupling (Days 1-2)**

**Problem:** Main application uses broken coupled architecture instead of working clean separation

**Action Items:**

```bash
# Day 1: Switch to Clean Architecture
cd ai-security-relaynode/src/

# 1. Replace main.rs with clean architecture
mv main.rs main_legacy.rs
mv main_clean.rs main.rs

# 2. Update lib.rs exports
# Remove coupled exports:
# - pub mod services;
# - pub mod subnet_manager;
# - pub use subnet_manager::{SubnetManager, SubnetStatus};

# 3. Test clean architecture build
cargo check
cargo build --release
```

**Implementation:**

echo "ðŸŽ‰ Architecture coupling fixed! Production now uses clean separation."
