### Brief Overview of IPFS and Its Importance

**IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. Unlike traditional centralized servers, IPFS enables a decentralized and distributed approach to data storage and retrieval. Here are some key aspects and benefits of IPFS:

#### Key Aspects of IPFS:

1. **Content-Addressed Storage**:
   - In IPFS, files are identified by their cryptographic hash rather than their location. This ensures data integrity and allows for efficient content retrieval.

2. **Distributed and Decentralized**:
   - IPFS distributes data across a network of nodes. This decentralization reduces the reliance on central servers and enhances data availability and redundancy.

3. **Immutable and Versioned**:
   - Data stored in IPFS is immutable, meaning once a file is added, it cannot be altered. New versions of the file can be added without affecting the original, enabling version control.

4. **Efficient Data Retrieval**:
   - IPFS uses a content-addressable network to locate and retrieve data from the nearest nodes, optimizing bandwidth and reducing latency.

#### Benefits of IPFS:

1. **Enhanced Data Availability**:
   - By distributing data across multiple nodes, IPFS ensures that files remain available even if some nodes go offline.

2. **Improved Performance**:
   - Local caching and content addressing enable faster data retrieval, reducing the time it takes to access files.

3. **Data Integrity and Security**:
   - The use of cryptographic hashes guarantees that the data retrieved is the same as the data that was stored, preventing tampering and ensuring data integrity.

4. **Reduced Centralization**:
   - IPFS reduces the dependence on centralized servers, making the web more resilient to censorship and outages.

By integrating IPFS into your SubNet RelayNode, you can leverage these benefits to build a robust, efficient, and decentralized network that enhances data storage and retrieval capabilities within your localized network.

       console.log('Message sent:', event);
     };

     const receiveMessages = (callback: (message: any) => void) => {
       if (!nostrRelay) {
         console.error('Nostr relay not initialized');
         return;
       }

       nostrRelay.on('event', (event: any) => {
         console.log('Received message:', event);
         callback(event);
       });
     };

     export { initNostr, sendMessage, receiveMessages };
     ```

2. **Create a Messaging Component**:
   - In your `src/components` directory, create a file named `MessageDisplay.tsx` and add the following code:
     ```typescript
     import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
     import { sendMessage, receiveMessages } from '../nostrService';

     const MessageDisplay: React.FC = () => {
       const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
       const [messages, setMessages] = useState<string[]>([]);

       useEffect(() => {
         receiveMessages((event: any) => {
           setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, event.content]);
         });
       }, []);

       const handleSend = async () => {
         await sendMessage(message);
         setMessage('');
       };

       return (
         <div className="message-display">
           <h2>Messaging</h2>
           <input
             type="text"
             value={message}
             onChange={(e) => setMessage(e.target.value)}
           />
           <button onClick={handleSend}>Send</button>
           <div>
             <h3>Received Messages:</h3>
             <ul>
               {messages.map((msg, index) => (
                 <li key={index}>{msg}</li>
               ))}
             </ul>
