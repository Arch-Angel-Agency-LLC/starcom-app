## Overview

This instruction manual provides foundational skills and best practices for college graduates entering the professional world. It covers essential concepts and tools such as version control, code quality, CI/CD, documentation, and soft skills.

## Version Control with Git

### Basic Git Commands

- **Initialize a Repository**:
  ```sh
  git init
  ```

- **Clone a Repository**:
  ```sh
  git clone <repository_url>
  ```

- **Check Status**:
  ```sh
  git status
  ```

- **Stage Changes**:
  ```sh
  git add <file>
  ```

- **Commit Changes**:
  ```sh
  git commit -m "Commit message"
  ```

- **Push Changes**:
  ```sh
  git push origin <branch>
  ```

- **Pull Changes**:
  ```sh
  git pull origin <branch>
  ```

### Branching and Merging

- **Create a New Branch**:
  ```sh
  git checkout -b <branch_name>
  ```

- **Switch to an Existing Branch**:
  ```sh
  git checkout <branch_name>
  ```

- **Merge a Branch**:
  ```sh
  git merge <branch_name>
  ```

### Best Practices

- **Frequent Commits**: Commit your changes frequently with clear and concise commit messages.
- **Use Branches**: Use branches for new features, bug fixes, and experiments.
- **Pull Before Push**: Always pull the latest changes before pushing your changes.

## Code Quality and Reviews

### Code Linting and Formatting

- **Install ESLint**:
  ```sh
  npm install eslint --save-dev
  ```

- **Initialize ESLint**:
  ```sh
  npx eslint --init
  ```

- **Run ESLint**:
  ```sh
  npx eslint <file>
  ```

- **Install Prettier**:
  ```sh
  npm install prettier --save-dev
  ```

- **Create Prettier Configuration File**:
  ```json
  {
    "singleQuote": true,
    "trailingComma": "all"
  }
  ```

### Writing Clean Code

- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use meaningful and consistent names for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Modular Code**: Break down complex functions and components into smaller, reusable pieces.
- **Avoid Code Duplication**: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### Conducting Code Reviews

- **Review Code Thoroughly**: Check for logic errors, code style, and performance issues.
- **Provide Constructive Feedback**: Be respectful and provide actionable suggestions.
- **Request Feedback**: Encourage team members to review your code and provide feedback.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### Setting Up CI/CD Pipelines

- **Define a Pipeline**: Create a pipeline configuration file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for GitHub Actions).
  ```yaml
  name: CI Pipeline

  on: [push, pull_request]

  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Set up Node.js
          uses: actions/setup-node@v2
          with:
            node-version: '14'
        - run: npm install
        - run: npm test
  ```

### Popular CI/CD Tools

- **GitHub Actions**: Integrated with GitHub, easy to set up.
- **Travis CI**: Simple and free for open source projects.
- **CircleCI**: Powerful and flexible, supports multiple programming languages.

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- **JSDoc**: Use JSDoc comments to document your code.
  ```js
  /**
   * Adds two numbers.
   * @param {number} a - The first number.
   * @param {number} b - The second number.
   * @returns {number} The sum of the two numbers.
   */
  function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  ```

### API Documentation

- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Use Swagger/OpenAPI to document your APIs.
  ```yaml
  openapi: 3.0.0
  info:
    title: My API
    version: 1.0.0
  paths:
    /users:
      get:
        summary: Get users
        responses:
          '200':
            description: Successful response
  ```

### Project Documentation

- **README.md**: Create a `README.md` file to document your project's purpose, setup instructions, and usage.
  ```markdown
  # Project Name

  ## Description
  A brief description of the project.

  ## Installation
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

  ## Usage
  ```sh
  npm start
  ```

## Soft Skills for Developers

### Communication

- **Clear Communication**: Clearly articulate your ideas and feedback.
- **Active Listening**: Listen to your colleagues and understand their perspectives.
- **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to ask questions if you're unsure about something.

### Team Collaboration

- **Team Meetings**: Participate actively in team meetings and discussions.
- **Pair Programming**: Collaborate with team members through pair programming.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share your knowledge and expertise with the team.

### Time Management

- **Prioritize Tasks**: Prioritize your tasks based on importance and deadlines.
- **Set Goals**: Set clear and achievable goals for your work.
- **Avoid Multitasking**: Focus on one task at a time to improve productivity.
