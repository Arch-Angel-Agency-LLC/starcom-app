## Software Development Methodologies

### Agile

- **Overview**: Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.
- **Key Principles**: Deliver working software frequently, welcome changing requirements, and prioritize customer satisfaction.
- **Frameworks**: Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP).

### Scrum

- **Overview**: Scrum is an Agile framework that divides work into fixed-length iterations called sprints.
- **Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
- **Ceremonies**: Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-up, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.
- **Artifacts**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.

### Kanban

- **Overview**: Kanban is an Agile framework that visualizes work on a board and manages flow using a pull system.
- **Key Concepts**: Visualize work, limit work in progress (WIP), manage flow, and continuously improve.

## Project Management Tools

### JIRA

- **Overview**: JIRA is a popular project management tool used for tracking and managing software development projects.
- **Features**: Issue tracking, agile boards, roadmaps, reports, and integrations with other tools.
- **Best Practices**: Use epics and stories to organize work, create custom workflows, and leverage dashboards for reporting.

### Trello

- **Overview**: Trello is a flexible project management tool that uses boards, lists, and cards to organize tasks.
- **Features**: Drag-and-drop interface, checklists, due dates, attachments, and integrations.
- **Best Practices**: Use labels and due dates to prioritize tasks, create checklists for task breakdown, and collaborate with team members using comments.

### Asana

- **Overview**: Asana is a project management tool designed to help teams organize, track, and manage their work.
- **Features**: Task management, project timelines, workload management, and integrations.
- **Best Practices**: Use task dependencies to manage workflows, set up project templates for recurring tasks, and use dashboards to monitor progress.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Structural Patterns

- **Adapter**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Decorator**: Adds additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

### Behavioral Patterns

- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests.

## API Development

### RESTful APIs

- **Overview**: REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
- **Principles**: Statelessness, client-server architecture, cacheability, uniform interface, layered system, and code on demand.
- **Best Practices**: Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), design meaningful URIs, and handle errors gracefully.

### GraphQL

- **Overview**: GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
- **Advantages**: Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data, provides a more flexible and efficient data-fetching mechanism.
- **Best Practices**: Define clear and concise schema, use fragments for reusable units, and implement pagination and rate limiting.

### API Security

- **Authentication**: Use OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or API keys to authenticate API requests.
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) to restrict access to resources.
- **Data Encryption**: Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

## Database Management

### SQL vs. NoSQL

- **SQL Databases**: Relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server.
- **NoSQL Databases**: Non-relational databases designed for specific data models and flexible schemas. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.

### ORMs

- **Overview**: Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) provide a way to interact with databases using object-oriented programming languages.
- **Popular ORMs**: Sequelize (for Node.js), TypeORM (for TypeScript), Hibernate (for Java), Entity Framework (for .NET).
- **Best Practices**: Define clear models and relationships, use migrations for schema changes, and optimize queries.

### Database Optimization

- **Indexing**: Use indexes to speed up query performance.
- **Normalization**: Normalize your database schema to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Query Optimization**: Analyze and optimize slow queries using query planners and execution plans.

## Cloud Computing and Deployment

- **Popular Services**: EC2 (compute), S3 (storage), RDS (database), Lambda (serverless computing).
- **Best Practices**: Use IAM for access control, implement cost management, and leverage automation tools like CloudFormation and Terraform.

### Azure

- **Overview**: Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and service.
- **Popular Services**: Virtual Machines, Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions.
- **Best Practices**: Use Azure Active Directory for identity management, monitor resources with Azure Monitor, and automate deployments with Azure DevOps.

### Google Cloud Platform

- **Overview**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers cloud computing services.
- **Popular Services**: Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Functions.
- **Best Practices**: Use IAM for security, implement cost management strategies, and automate infrastructure with Deployment Manager and Terraform.
