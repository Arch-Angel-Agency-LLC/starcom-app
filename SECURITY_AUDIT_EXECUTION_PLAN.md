# Security Audit Execution Plan

**Project:** Starcom App Documentation Security Audit  
**Created:** August 5, 2025  
**Total Files to Audit:** 1,183 markdown files  
**Estimated Duration:** 5-7 business days  

## Overview

This document provides a step-by-step execution plan to systematically audit all 1,183 markdown files in the Starcom App repository for security vulnerabilities, credential exposure, and privacy compliance issues.

## PHASE 1: CRITICAL SECURITY SCAN (Priority: URGENT)
**Target:** Root-level high-risk files  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours  
**Files:** 9 files  

### Step 1.1: Automated Credential Scan
**Files to scan:**
1. `ANALYTICS_SETUP.md`
2. `TELEGRAM_BOT_SETUP.md` 
3. `GRANT_ANALYTICS_ACCESS.md`
4. `DEBUG_CONTROL.md`
5. `DEBUG_SIGNATURE_REFERENCE.md`
6. `LOGGING_CONTROL_SUMMARY.md`
7. `README.md`
8. `src/SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
9. `contracts/intel-market/README.md`

**Sub-steps:**
1. **Automated keyword search for each file:**
   ```bash
   # Search for API keys and tokens
   grep -i "api_key\|apikey\|api-key\|token\|secret\|password\|pwd" filename.md
   
   # Search for specific service credentials
   grep -i "google.*key\|telegram.*token\|bot.*token\|oauth\|client_secret" filename.md
   
   # Search for URLs that might contain credentials
   grep -E "https?://[^/]*:[^@]*@|key=[^&\s]+|token=[^&\s]+" filename.md
   ```

2. **Manual review for each file:**
   - Open each file in editor
   - Look for configuration blocks, setup instructions
   - Check for example code that might contain real credentials
   - Verify all credentials are placeholders (e.g., `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`)

3. **Documentation of findings:**
   - Create `PHASE1_FINDINGS.md`
   - Record exact line numbers and content of any issues found
   - Classify severity: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW

### Step 1.2: Immediate Remediation
**Sub-steps:**
1. **For any CRITICAL findings (real credentials):**
   - Immediately replace with placeholder values
   - Add to `.gitignore` if it's a config file that should be private
   - Consider if credentials need to be rotated

2. **For HIGH findings (potential credentials):**
   - Review context to determine if real or placeholder
   - Replace with clearly marked placeholders if unclear

3. **Document changes made:**
   - Git commit with message: "SECURITY: Remove/sanitize credentials in documentation"

## PHASE 2: PRIVACY DATA AUDIT (Priority: HIGH)
**Target:** Case data files with potential PII  
**Duration:** 8-12 hours  
**Files:** 200+ files in "The Long Island Case" directories  

### Step 2.1: PII Pattern Detection
**Sub-steps:**
1. **Automated PII scanning:**
   ```bash
   # Scan for phone numbers
   find . -name "*.md" -path "*/The Long Island Case/*" -exec grep -l "\b\d{3}[-.]?\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}\b" {} \;
   
   # Scan for email addresses
   find . -name "*.md" -path "*/The Long Island Case/*" -exec grep -l "\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b" {} \;
   
   # Scan for addresses (basic pattern)
   find . -name "*.md" -path "*/The Long Island Case/*" -exec grep -l "\b\d+\s+[A-Za-z]+\s+(Street|St|Avenue|Ave|Road|Rd|Lane|Ln|Drive|Dr)\b" {} \;
   
   # Scan for SSNs
   find . -name "*.md" -path "*/The Long Island Case/*" -exec grep -l "\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b" {} \;
   ```

2. **Sample file review:**
   - Review 10 random files from each category (People, Organizations, Establishments, Regions)
   - Determine data sensitivity level
   - Check if data appears to be real vs. fictional

### Step 2.2: Privacy Classification
**Sub-steps:**
1. **Classify case data files:**
   - **REMOVE:** Files containing real PII that should not be public
   - **ANONYMIZE:** Files with real names/data that should be fictionalized
   - **KEEP:** Files with fictional/public data that's safe for open source

2. **Create classification report:**
   - Document findings in `PHASE2_PRIVACY_CLASSIFICATION.md`
   - Include recommendations for each file/directory

### Step 2.3: Data Sanitization
**Sub-steps:**
1. **For REMOVE classification:**
   - Move files to a private repository or delete entirely
   - Update any references in other documentation

2. **For ANONYMIZE classification:**
   - Replace real names with fictional equivalents
   - Replace real addresses with fictional locations
   - Maintain data structure but remove identifying information

3. **Document sanitization log:**
   - Keep record of what was changed for legal compliance

## PHASE 3: API & TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION REVIEW (Priority: HIGH)
**Target:** API docs and technical configuration files  
**Duration:** 4-6 hours  
**Files:** ~50 files  

### Step 3.1: API Documentation Security Scan
**Files to review:**
1. All files in `docs/api/` (5 files)
2. All files containing "API", "endpoint", "service" in filename
3. Configuration and setup documentation

**Sub-steps:**
1. **Scan for exposed endpoints:**
   ```bash
   # Look for API endpoints that might be internal
   grep -r "http.*api\." docs/
   grep -r "localhost:\|127.0.0.1\|\.local\|\.dev" docs/
   
   # Look for database connection strings
   grep -r "mongodb://\|postgres://\|mysql://\|redis://" docs/
   ```

2. **Review API documentation for:**
   - Hardcoded API endpoints (should be configurable)
   - Example requests with real data
   - Authentication examples with real tokens
   - Internal service URLs

### Step 3.2: Configuration File Review
**Sub-steps:**
1. **Security configuration audit:**
   - Review debug settings documentation
   - Check logging configuration for sensitive data exposure
   - Verify no hardcoded security settings

2. **Documentation compliance:**
   - Ensure all examples use placeholder values
   - Verify setup instructions don't expose internal systems

## PHASE 4: ARCHIVED DOCUMENTATION AUDIT (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Target:** Legacy and archived documentation  
**Duration:** 6-8 hours  
**Files:** 500+ archived files  

### Step 4.1: Automated Historical Scan
**Sub-steps:**
1. **Bulk credential scanning:**
   ```bash
   # Scan all archived docs for credentials
   find docs/archived -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "api_key\|token\|secret\|password" {} \;
   
   # Look for old deployment configs that might contain real data
   find docs/archived -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "deploy\|config\|env\|production" {} \;
   ```

2. **Sample review strategy:**
   - Review 1 in every 10 files from each archived subdirectory
   - Focus on files with dates (likely to contain historical data)
   - Priority on implementation reports and status documents

### Step 4.2: Legacy Cleanup
**Sub-steps:**
1. **Identify obsolete documentation:**
   - Mark files that are no longer relevant
   - Consider moving very old docs to a separate archive

2. **Sanitize historical content:**
   - Remove any credentials found in historical documentation
   - Update references to internal systems

## PHASE 5: SOURCE CODE DOCUMENTATION AUDIT (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Target:** Documentation within source code directories  
**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Files:** ~40 files  

### Step 5.1: Development Documentation Review
**Sub-steps:**
1. **Component and module documentation:**
   - Review README files in component directories
   - Check implementation summaries for exposed internals
   - Verify no development secrets in documentation

2. **Build and deployment docs:**
   - Check for hardcoded paths or configurations
   - Verify no internal server references
   - Ensure deployment instructions use proper placeholders

## PHASE 6: COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION (Priority: LOW)
**Target:** Final validation and documentation  
**Duration:** 2-3 hours  

### Step 6.1: Final Security Sweep
**Sub-steps:**
1. **Complete repository scan:**
   ```bash
   # Final comprehensive scan for any missed credentials
   find . -name "*.md" -not -path "./node_modules/*" -exec grep -l "api_key\|token\|secret\|password\|key=" {} \;
   
   # Scan for email addresses that might be real
   find . -name "*.md" -not -path "./node_modules/*" -exec grep -l "@.*\.(com|org|net|edu|gov)" {} \;
   ```

2. **Documentation review:**
   - Verify all security issues documented
   - Confirm all remediations completed
   - Update audit index with final status

### Step 6.2: Compliance Documentation
**Sub-steps:**
1. **Create final audit report:**
   - Summary of all findings and remediations
   - Risk assessment of remaining documentation
   - Recommendations for ongoing security practices

2. **Update project documentation:**
   - Add security guidelines for future documentation
   - Document the audit process for future reference
