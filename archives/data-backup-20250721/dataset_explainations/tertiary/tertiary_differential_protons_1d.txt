The JSON file tertiary_differential_protons_1d.json contains differential proton flux data collected by NOAA’s GOES-18 satellite over a 1-day period. This dataset provides measurements of proton flux at various energy levels, which are crucial for space weather analysis, radiation storm detection, and geomagnetic storm forecasting.

Breakdown of Key Fields
	1.	time_tag – Timestamp (UTC) of the recorded measurement.
	2.	satellite – Identifier of the NOAA satellite (GOES-18 in this dataset).
	3.	flux – Measured proton flux (particles per cm²·s·sr).
	4.	energy – The energy range of detected protons (e.g., “1020-1860 keV”, “115000-143000 keV”).
	5.	channel – Proton energy measurement channel (e.g., P1, P2A, P3, P7, P8C).
	6.	yaw_flip – Indicator of satellite yaw flip (0 means no flip, 1 means flipped orientation).

Purpose of This Data
	•	Radiation Storm Warnings:
	•	Elevated proton flux levels indicate solar energetic particle (SEP) events, which can disrupt satellites and pose a radiation hazard to astronauts.
	•	Geomagnetic Storm Forecasting:
	•	High-energy proton storms contribute to magnetospheric disturbances affecting power grids, GPS, and communication networks.
	•	Solar Activity Monitoring:
	•	Helps detect coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares, which accelerate protons to high speeds.
	•	Satellite and Aviation Protection:
	•	Helps in issuing radiation alerts for aircraft flying over polar regions.
	•	Space Weather Impact Assessment:
	•	Provides data to predict ionospheric disturbances affecting HF radio and GPS signals.

Understanding Proton Flux Levels

Proton Energy Range	Impact
1020-1860 keV	Normal background levels
11640-23270 keV	Slightly elevated levels can signal increased activity
115000-143000 keV	High-energy protons, potential for satellite disruptions
276000-404000 keV	Extremely high-energy protons, may indicate strong space weather events

	•	Proton flux values above 10 particles/cm²·s·sr indicate significant space weather events.
	•	High-energy protons (>100 MeV) can cause satellite charging, radio blackouts, and radiation hazards.

🔹 Recent observations indicate stable proton flux levels, suggesting normal space weather conditions.
🔸 Any rapid increase in high-energy proton levels would indicate an incoming radiation storm or CME event.
