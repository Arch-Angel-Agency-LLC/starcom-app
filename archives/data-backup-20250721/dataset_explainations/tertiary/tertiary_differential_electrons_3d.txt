The JSON file tertiary_differential_electrons_3d.json contains differential electron flux data collected by GOES-16 for a 3-day period. This dataset measures electron flux at various energy levels, which is crucial for monitoring space weather conditions, particularly the behavior of electrons in Earth’s radiation belts.

Breakdown of Key Fields
	1.	time_tag – Timestamp (UTC) of the recorded measurement.
	2.	satellite – Identifier of the NOAA satellite (GOES-16).
	3.	flux – Measured electron flux (particles per cm²·s·sr).
	4.	energy – The energy range of detected electrons (e.g., “1000-1900 keV”, “80-115 keV”).

Purpose of This Data
	•	Monitoring Earth’s Radiation Belts:
	•	This data tracks electron behavior in Earth’s magnetosphere and Van Allen radiation belts.
	•	Space Weather Impact Assessment:
	•	High-energy electron storms can cause satellite anomalies, spacecraft charging, and GPS disruptions.
	•	Prediction of Geomagnetic Storm Effects:
	•	Increases in electron flux at specific energy levels can signal impending geomagnetic disturbances.
	•	Satellite & Spacecraft Protection:
	•	Space weather models use this data to forecast hazardous conditions for satellites and astronauts.
	•	HF Radio & GPS Signal Disruptions:
	•	Electron flux variations can affect radio wave propagation, impacting aviation and military communications.

Understanding Differential Electron Flux

Electron Energy Range	Impact
80-115 keV	Background levels, minimal space weather effects
115-165 keV	Slight increase, potential early signs of activity
700-1000 keV	Moderate geomagnetic activity possible
1000-1900 keV	High-energy electrons, potential for satellite anomalies
3200-6500 keV	Extremely high energy, may indicate a strong space weather event

	•	High flux values (> 10,000 particles/cm²·s·sr) suggest enhanced solar activity.
	•	Low values indicate calm space weather conditions.

Recent Data Observations

Date (UTC)	Electron Flux (80-115 keV)	Electron Flux (1000-1900 keV)
2025-02-20 02:20	14,290	0.449
2025-02-20 02:25	9,864	0.231
2025-02-20 02:30	16,199	0.580
2025-02-20 02:35	21,389	0.900
2025-02-20 02:40	18,346	1.044

🔹 Electron flux in the 80-115 keV range has increased significantly over the observation period.
🔸 Higher-energy electron flux (1000-1900 keV) is rising but remains low, suggesting no immediate radiation storm.
