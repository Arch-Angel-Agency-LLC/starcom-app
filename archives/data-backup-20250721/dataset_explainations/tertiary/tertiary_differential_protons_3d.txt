The JSON file tertiary_differential_protons_3d.json contains differential proton flux data recorded over a 3-day period by NOAA‚Äôs GOES-18 satellite. This dataset measures proton flux levels at different energy ranges, providing insights into solar radiation activity and space weather effects.

Key Fields in the Data
	1.	time_tag ‚Äì Timestamp of the measurement in UTC.
	2.	satellite ‚Äì Identifies the NOAA satellite (GOES-18).
	3.	flux ‚Äì Proton flux intensity (particles per cm¬≤¬∑s¬∑sr).
	4.	energy ‚Äì Proton energy levels (e.g., ‚Äú1020-1860 keV‚Äù, ‚Äú115000-143000 keV‚Äù).
	5.	yaw_flip ‚Äì Indicates whether the satellite flipped orientation (0 = normal, 1 = flipped).
	6.	channel ‚Äì Measurement channel (e.g., P1, P2A, P3, P9, P10).

Purpose of This Data
	‚Ä¢	Solar Radiation Monitoring
	‚Ä¢	Tracks proton emissions from the Sun, helping detect solar energetic particle (SEP) events.
	‚Ä¢	Geomagnetic Storm Forecasting
	‚Ä¢	Analyzes proton interactions with Earth‚Äôs magnetosphere, which can trigger geomagnetic storms.
	‚Ä¢	Radiation Hazard Detection
	‚Ä¢	Helps issue alerts for astronauts and satellites when radiation levels are high.
	‚Ä¢	Space Weather Analysis
	‚Ä¢	Identifies effects from coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares.

Understanding Proton Flux Levels

Energy Range (keV)	Significance
1020-1860	Background flux levels.
11640-23270	Slightly elevated, indicating solar activity.
115000-143000	High-energy protons, potential for geomagnetic impact.
276000-404000	Extreme energy levels, can disrupt electronics and GPS.

üìå A sharp increase in flux levels suggests a solar radiation event or CME impact.

üîπ Recent observations show stable proton flux levels, suggesting normal space weather conditions.
üî∏ If high-energy flux levels rise rapidly, it may indicate an incoming solar radiation storm.
