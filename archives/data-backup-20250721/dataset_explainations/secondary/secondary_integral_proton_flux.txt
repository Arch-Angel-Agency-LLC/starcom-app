The JSON file secondary_integral_proton_flux.json contains solar proton flux data from NOAA, recorded by the GOES-18 satellite. This dataset measures proton fluence, which represents the total number of high-energy protons detected over a given period, providing critical insights into solar particle events (SPEs) and space weather conditions.

Breakdown of Key Fields:
	1.	energy â€“ The minimum energy threshold for recorded protons:
	â€¢	â‰¥1 MeV (low-energy protons)
	â€¢	â‰¥10 MeV (high-energy protons)
	2.	instrument â€“ The type of instrument collecting the data (protons).
	3.	satellite â€“ The NOAA GOES-18 satellite that recorded the data.
	4.	time_tag â€“ The timestamp (UTC) of the measurement.
	5.	fluence â€“ The proton fluence, which represents the cumulative number of protons per unit area over a given period.

Purpose of This Data:
	â€¢	Monitoring Space Weather: Proton flux levels help detect solar storms, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and solar energetic particle (SEP) events.
	â€¢	Radiation Hazard Assessment:
	â€¢	High-energy protons can pose a radiation risk to astronauts, satellites, and high-altitude aircraft.
	â€¢	Satellite Protection: Intense solar particle events can cause satellite charging, communication disruptions, and potential system failures.
	â€¢	Geomagnetic Storm Prediction: Elevated proton levels can indicate an incoming geomagnetic storm.
	â€¢	Aurora Forecasting: Proton storms contribute to auroral activity, affecting their intensity and location.

Understanding Proton Fluence Levels:
	â€¢	Higher fluence values indicate a stronger presence of solar protons, often associated with space weather disturbances.
	â€¢	Increases in â‰¥10 MeV protons are particularly concerning for radiation hazards.
	â€¢	Sharp rises in fluence suggest an ongoing solar storm or coronal mass ejection impact.

Recent Data Observations:

Date (UTC)	Proton Fluence (â‰¥1 MeV)	Proton Fluence (â‰¥10 MeV)
2025-02-17	503,939	16,614
2025-02-18	779,467	16,529
2025-02-19	341,639	15,760
2025-02-20	45,198	16,462
2025-02-21	82,894	18,058
2025-02-22	12,335,233	26,353

ðŸ”´ Significant Increase on Feb 22:
	â€¢	Proton fluence (â‰¥1 MeV) jumped to 12.3 millionâ€”a massive spike, suggesting a solar particle event (SPE).
	â€¢	â‰¥10 MeV protons also increased, which could indicate radiation risk to satellites and astronauts.

How This Data Is Used:
	â€¢	NOAA, NASA, and Space Weather Agencies use it for real-time monitoring of solar particle events.
	â€¢	Satellite Operators track it to prevent damage from high-energy protons.
	â€¢	Aviation Industry monitors it for radiation exposure risks on high-altitude flights.
	â€¢	Aurora Forecasters use it to predict solar-driven auroras.
