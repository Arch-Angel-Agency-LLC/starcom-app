## 🏗️ Dual Architecture Design

### 1. **Starcom Web dApp** (`./dapp/`)
The primary user interface - a sophisticated React/TypeScript application featuring:

- **3D Cyber Command Interface**: Interactive global visualization
- **Intelligence Marketplace**: NFT-based intelligence trading
- **Real-Time Communications**: Nostr protocol integration
- **Wallet Integration**: Solana/Ethereum Web3 connectivity
- **Serverless Deployment**: No backend dependencies

**Current State**: Fully functional development environment with comprehensive UI components, 3D globe engine, and Web3 integrations.

### 2. **AI Security RelayNode** (`./ai-security-relaynode/`)
Optional desktop application providing enhanced capabilities:

- **Local Nostr Relay**: Team-owned communication infrastructure
- **IPFS Storage Node**: Decentralized content storage
- **Enhanced Security**: Post-quantum cryptography
- **Team Isolation**: Private subnet capabilities
- **Real-Time Performance**: WebSocket optimization

**Current State**: Core architecture implemented, builds successfully, basic services operational.

## 🔄 Integration Strategy

The platform uses **adaptive service detection**:

1. **With RelayNode**: Enhanced real-time features, team-owned infrastructure
2. **Without RelayNode**: Full functionality via public relays and IPFS gateways
3. **Hybrid Mode**: Mix of local and public services based on availability

```typescript
// Automatic detection and adaptation
if (await detectLocalRelayNode()) {
  // Use local services for optimal performance
  connectToLocalServices();
} else {
  // Fallback to public infrastructure
  connectToPublicRelays();
}
```
