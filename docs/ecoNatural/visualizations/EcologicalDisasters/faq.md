# Ecological Disasters FAQ

## Mock volcano data
- Why mock? A live volcano feed is not available in this build; mock points illustrate UI/legend behavior.
- How is it labeled? Chips and tooltips include "Volcano data is mock" and a screenreader-only note.
- Impact: Counts and severity visuals include mock entries; do not use for real-world decisions.
- Future plan: Replace mock volcanoes with live provider feed when licensed; remove the disclaimer at that time.
