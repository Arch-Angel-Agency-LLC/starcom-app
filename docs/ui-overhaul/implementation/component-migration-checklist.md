# Component Migration Checklist

**Status:** Active  
**Last Updated:** July 6, 2025

This checklist provides a standardized process for migrating existing components to the new UI architecture. Use this document when moving functionality from the current structure to the new modular architecture.

## Pre-Migration Assessment

- [ ] **Identify Component Purpose**
  - Determine the primary functionality of the component
  - Identify which new screen it belongs in
  - Document any dependencies on other components

- [ ] **State Management Analysis**
  - Map out current state management approach
  - Identify state that should move to ViewContext
  - Note any localStorage or sessionStorage dependencies

- [ ] **API Integration Points**
  - Document all API calls made by the component
  - Identify any real-time data subscriptions
  - Note authentication requirements

- [ ] **UI/UX Considerations**
  - Evaluate current UI patterns for consistency with new design
  - Identify any custom styling that needs standardization
  - Note accessibility features that must be preserved

## Component Extraction

- [ ] **Code Isolation**
  - Create a copy of the component in its new location
  - Remove dependencies on the old architecture
  - Update import paths for dependencies

- [ ] **Props Restructuring**
  - Convert any render props to standard props
  - Update prop types to match new architecture standards
  - Add defaultProps where appropriate

- [ ] **State Migration**
  - Move component state to ViewContext where appropriate
  - Update state access patterns to use hooks
  - Ensure state initialization happens correctly

- [ ] **Event Handler Updates**
  - Update event handlers to work with new architecture
  - Ensure proper binding of methods
  - Verify event propagation behaves correctly

## Integration into New Architecture

- [ ] **Screen Placement**
  - Position component within the appropriate screen
  - Ensure layout works within the new container structure
  - Verify responsive behavior

- [ ] **Context Integration**
  - Connect to ViewContext for state management
  - Update references to global state
  - Ensure context updates trigger appropriate re-renders

- [ ] **Navigation Integration**
  - Update any navigation logic to use new patterns
  - Ensure deep linking works correctly
  - Verify browser history behavior

- [ ] **Style Standardization**
  - Apply new design system styles
  - Remove any inline styles
  - Ensure theme consistency

## Testing

- [ ] **Functionality Verification**
  - Test all interactive elements
  - Verify data display is correct
  - Ensure all features from original component work

- [ ] **State Management Testing**
  - Test state updates and reactions
  - Verify context integration
  - Check for any state leaks or memory issues

- [ ] **Edge Case Testing**
  - Test with minimum and maximum data sets
  - Verify error handling
  - Check performance with typical workloads

- [ ] **Cross-browser Testing**
  - Verify in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
  - Test mobile browsers if applicable
  - Check for any browser-specific issues

## Documentation

- [ ] **Update Component Documentation**
  - Document the component's new location and purpose
  - Update any API documentation
  - Note any changes in functionality

- [ ] **Props Documentation**
  - Document all props and their types
  - Note any required props
  - Provide examples of common prop values

- [ ] **Integration Examples**
  - Provide examples of how to use the component
  - Document common patterns and anti-patterns
  - Include code snippets for typical use cases

## Post-Migration

- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking**
  - Compare performance to original component
  - Identify any opportunities for optimization
  - Document any significant changes

- [ ] **Accessibility Audit**
  - Verify ARIA attributes
  - Test keyboard navigation
  - Ensure screen reader compatibility

- [ ] **Remove Legacy Code**
  - After successful migration and testing, remove original component
  - Update any references to the old component
  - Clean up unused dependencies

## Final Approval

- [ ] **Code Review**
  - Have another developer review the migration
  - Ensure all standards are followed
  - Address any feedback

- [ ] **UX Review**
  - Verify the component meets design standards
  - Ensure consistent user experience
  - Check for any UX regressions

- [ ] **Product Owner Sign-off**
  - Demonstrate the migrated component
  - Confirm all requirements are met
  - Get formal approval for the migration
