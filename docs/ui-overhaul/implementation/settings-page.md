# Settings Page Implementation

**Created:** July 6, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress

This document describes the implementation of the Settings Page and its screens in the Starcom App. The Settings Page provides a unified interface for users to configure all aspects of the application.

## Overview

The Settings Page is a top-level page in the application that contains multiple settings screens. It uses the ViewContext system to handle navigation between different settings screens while maintaining a consistent layout.

## Structure

### 1. `SettingsPage` Component

The main container component in `/src/pages/SettingsPage/SettingsPage.tsx` provides:

- A consistent layout with header and navigation sidebar
- Integration with ViewContext for screen state
- Navigation between settings screens

```tsx
const SettingsPage: React.FC = () => {
  const { currentScreen, navigateToScreen } = useView();
  
  // Render the appropriate settings screen based on currentScreen
  const renderSettingsScreen = () => {
    switch (currentScreen) {
      case 'profile':
        return <ProfileSettings />;
      case 'appearance':
        return <AppearanceSettings />;
      // ... other screens
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <div className={styles.settingsPage}>
      <div className={styles.settingsHeader}>...</div>
      <div className={styles.settingsContainer}>
        <div className={styles.settingsSidebar}>...</div>
        <div className={styles.settingsContent}>
          {renderSettingsScreen()}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 2. Settings Screens

Individual settings screens are implemented as separate components in the `/src/pages/SettingsPage/Screens/` directory:

- **ProfileSettings**: User profile and account settings
- **AppearanceSettings**: Theme, UI scale, and visual preferences
- **SecuritySettings**: Authentication, encryption, and security options
- **NotificationSettings**: Alert preferences and notification channels
- **AdvancedSettings**: Performance, experimental features, and debugging

Each screen follows a consistent pattern with sections, setting groups, and standardized UI controls.

### 3. Route Integration

Settings screens are integrated with our route synchronization system:

- Each settings screen has a corresponding route (e.g., `/settings/profile`)
- The SettingsPage component uses ViewContext to determine which screen to display
- When navigating between settings screens, both the URL and ViewContext state are updated

```tsx
// In routes.tsx
<Route path="/settings" element={<Navigate to="/settings/profile" replace />} />
<Route path="/settings/profile" element={<SettingsPage />} />
<Route path="/settings/appearance" element={<SettingsPage />} />
// ... other settings routes
```

## UI Components

### 1. Settings Navigation

The settings sidebar provides navigation between different settings screens:

- Each settings category has an icon and label
- The active screen is highlighted
- Navigation updates both ViewContext and URL

### 2. Settings Controls

Standardized UI controls are used across all settings screens:

- Toggle switches for boolean settings
- Dropdown selects for options
- Sliders for ranges
- Radio buttons for exclusive choices
- Text inputs for free-form text

### 3. Common Patterns

Each settings screen follows these common patterns:

- Organized into logical sections with headings
- Related settings grouped together
- Action buttons (Save, Reset, etc.) at the bottom
- Consistent styling and spacing

## Current Status

- Basic structure of SettingsPage implemented
- Placeholder screen components created for all settings categories
- Navigation between settings screens working
- Route synchronization integrated
- UI styling implemented
- Actual settings functionality not yet implemented

## Next Steps

1. **Profile Settings**: Implement actual user profile management
2. **Appearance Settings**: Connect theme switching to global theme system
3. **Security Settings**: Implement authentication and security options
4. **Notification Settings**: Connect to notification system
5. **Advanced Settings**: Implement performance and debugging options
6. **Settings Persistence**: Save settings to localStorage or backend
7. **Settings Validation**: Add validation for user inputs
8. **Responsive Design**: Improve mobile view of settings screens

## Design Considerations

- **Accessibility**: All settings controls should be keyboard accessible and work with screen readers
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent styling and interaction patterns across all settings screens
- **Responsiveness**: Settings UI should adapt to different screen sizes
- **Performance**: Settings changes should apply immediately when possible
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear feedback for invalid inputs or failed operations

## Conclusion

The Settings Page implementation provides a unified and extensible system for application configuration. The modular structure makes it easy to add new settings categories and options as the application evolves.
