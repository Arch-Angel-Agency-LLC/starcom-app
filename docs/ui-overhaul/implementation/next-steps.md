# Next Steps for UI Overhaul

**Date:** July 6, 2025

## Completed
- ✅ Integrated NetRunner Dashboard with search functionality
- ✅ Set up the search hook (`useNetRunnerSearch`)
- ✅ Created type definitions for the NetRunner module
- ✅ Updated the ScreenLoader to use the actual NetRunnerScreen component
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect current progress

## Next Steps

### 1. Enhance NetRunner Dashboard (Priority: High)
- Implement advanced filtering capabilities for search
- Migrate entity extraction and visualization from the OSINT components
- Add dark web and blockchain data sources (with authentication)
- Implement OPSEC tools for secure operations
- Add data export functionality

### 2. Begin Analyzer Screen Implementation (Priority: Medium)
- Start migration of analysis tools from PowerHunt
- Implement visualization components for data analysis
- Create data processing workflow
- Connect with the NetRunner data collection

### 3. Continue NodeWeb Screen Implementation (Priority: Medium)
- Migrate network visualization from existing components
- Implement node interaction capabilities
- Create relationship mapping tools
- Connect with NetRunner for entity import

### 4. Implement Actual Settings Functionality (Priority: Low)
- Connect settings screens to application state
- Implement user profile management
- Add theme and appearance controls
- Implement security settings
- Add notification preferences
- Create advanced configuration options

### 5. Testing and Refinement (Priority: Ongoing)
- Test route synchronization with all screens
- Verify screen transitions and animations
- Validate data flow between components
- Ensure responsive design works across device sizes
- Test accessibility features

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure consistent error handling across all components
- Maintain TypeScript type safety for all new code
- Consider performance optimization for data-heavy operations
- Implement proper loading states and fallbacks
- Document all new components and hooks

## Resource Allocation
- Focus development efforts on the NetRunner and Analyzer screens first
- Schedule design reviews for new interface components
- Allocate time for documentation updates as features are completed

This plan provides a roadmap for the next phase of development. Progress should be tracked in the implementation progress tracker and updates should be communicated to the team regularly.
