# UI Overhaul Implementation Guide

**Status:** Active  
**Last Updated:** July 6, 2025

## Overview

This document provides practical guidelines and step-by-step instructions for implementing the Starcom App UI architectural overhaul. It serves as a roadmap for developers working on the migration from the current structure to the new modular architecture.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

- Create the core architectural components
- Establish the navigation structure
- Implement the basic layout components

### Phase 2: Migration (Next)

- Move existing functionality into the new structure
- Ensure backward compatibility where necessary
- Update routing and navigation

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Future)

- Improve UX with animations and transitions
- Add additional functionality to new components
- Refine responsive behaviors

### Phase 4: Optimization (Future)

- Performance testing and optimization
- Accessibility improvements
- Cross-device testing and refinement

## Current Sprint Tasks

### Core Structure Implementation

1. Create the App Container with GlobalHeader
2. Implement MainPage with MainBottomBar, MarqueeTopBar, and MainCenter
3. Set up SettingsPage structure
4. Establish ViewContext for state management

### Screen Migration

1. Move existing Globe functionality to GlobeScreen
2. Consolidate OSINT features into NetRunner and Analyzer screens
3. Implement NodeWeb and Timeline screens with basic functionality
4. Create CaseManager screen with placeholder components

### Navigation Implementation

1. Update MainBottomBar to handle screen navigation
2. Implement routing between MainPage and SettingsPage
3. Set up deep linking to specific screens
4. Create navigation history management

## Code Migration Guidelines

### Component Migration Process

1. **Identify** - Determine the components that need to be migrated
2. **Extract** - Separate the component from its current context
3. **Adapt** - Modify the component to work with the new architecture
4. **Integrate** - Place the component in its new location
5. **Test** - Verify the component works in the new structure

### State Management Updates

1. Move from direct state in components to ViewContext
2. Update components to consume context instead of managing their own state
3. Ensure state transitions are properly handled during navigation

### Route Structure Changes

1. Update route definitions to match the new hierarchy
2. Implement nested routes where appropriate
3. Ensure proper authentication and protection

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- Implement code splitting at the screen level
- Use React.lazy and Suspense for component loading
- Optimize bundle size for each screen

### Responsive Design

- Ensure all new components adapt to different screen sizes
- Implement mobile-specific navigation patterns
- Test across multiple device types and orientations

### Accessibility

- Apply ARIA roles and attributes to all interactive elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout the application
- Test with screen readers and assistive technologies

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Create tests for each new component
- Update existing tests for migrated components
- Ensure all navigation paths are covered

### Integration Testing

- Test screen transitions and state preservation
- Verify data flow between components
- Test authentication and authorization

### End-to-End Testing

- Create user journey tests for common workflows
- Test deep linking and browser navigation
- Verify cross-device compatibility

## Deployment Plan

### Staged Rollout

1. Deploy architecture foundation to staging environment
2. Test with a subset of users
3. Roll out screens progressively
4. Complete migration with full deployment

### Fallback Strategy

- Maintain ability to revert to previous architecture if critical issues arise
- Implement feature flags for incremental activation
- Monitor performance and error metrics closely
