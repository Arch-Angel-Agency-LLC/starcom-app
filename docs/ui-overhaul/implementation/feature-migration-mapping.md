## Component Dependencies

This section maps the dependencies between components that need to be considered during migration:

### GlobeScreen Dependencies
- Data layer services
- Location services
- 3D rendering utilities

### NetRunner Screen Dependencies
- Data collection services
- Source management utilities
- Query building components

### Analyzer Screen Dependencies
- Analysis algorithms
- Visualization libraries
- Reporting services

### NodeWeb Screen Dependencies
- Graph visualization libraries
- Data relationship services
- Interaction handlers

### Timeline Screen Dependencies
- Temporal data services
- Event handling utilities
- Chronology algorithms

### CaseManager Screen Dependencies
- Case data services
- Evidence management utilities
- Workflow components

## Migration Order Recommendation

To minimize disruption and ensure dependencies are properly handled, the following migration order is recommended:

1. **Foundation Components**
   - ViewContext
   - App Container
   - MainPage structure
   - Navigation components

2. **Core Screens**
   - GlobeScreen (most users' entry point)
   - NetRunner Screen (primary OSINT replacement)
   - Analyzer Screen (primary analysis tools)

3. **Supporting Screens**
   - NodeWeb Screen
   - Timeline Screen
   - CaseManager Screen

4. **Collaborative Screens**
   - Teams Screen
   - AI Agent Screen
   - BotRoster Screen

5. **Settings and Configuration**
   - SettingsPage and its screens

## Testing Considerations

During migration, particular attention should be paid to testing:

1. **Data Flow Continuity** - Ensure data moves correctly between screens
2. **State Preservation** - Verify state is maintained during navigation
3. **Performance Impact** - Monitor for any performance regression
4. **Authentication Boundaries** - Test protected routes and permissions
