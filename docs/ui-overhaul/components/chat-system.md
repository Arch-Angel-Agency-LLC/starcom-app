# Chat System Component

**Status:** Planned  
**Parent:** MainPage

## Overview

The Chat System component provides an integrated communication interface within the MainPage, allowing users to interact with AI assistants, team members, and external contacts. It serves as a persistent communication channel that remains accessible across different screens while adapting to the current context to provide relevant assistance and collaboration capabilities.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Conversational Interface

- **Message Display**: Shows conversation history with clear sender identification
- **Input System**: Provides text entry with support for commands, formatting, and attachments
- **Thread Management**: Organizes conversations into threads for better context management

### 2. AI Assistant Integration

- **Context-Aware Assistance**: Provides AI help relevant to the current screen and task
- **Command Processing**: Accepts specialized commands for system actions and queries
- **Information Retrieval**: Accesses and presents information from the knowledge base

### 3. Collaboration Tools

- **Team Chat**: Enables communication with team members across the platform
- **Sharing Interface**: Allows sharing of data, visualizations, and reports
- **Notification System**: Alerts users to new messages and mentions

### 4. Adaptability

- **Context Sensitivity**: Adapts available commands and suggestions to current screen
- **Collapsible Interface**: Can be minimized to maximize screen space when needed
- **Persistent State**: Maintains conversation context across screen transitions

## Component Structure

### Layout

- **Chat Container**: Flexible container that can be positioned in various layouts
- **Message List**: Scrollable area displaying conversation history
- **Input Area**: Text entry field with command and formatting controls
- **Control Bar**: Interface for managing chat visibility and configuration

### Visual Design

- **Clean Interface**: Minimal design that doesn't distract from primary screen content
- **Clear Threading**: Visual indicators for conversation threads and context
- **Sender Identification**: Distinct styling for different message sources (AI, team members, system)

## Interactions

### User Interactions

- **Text Entry**: Primary method for communication and command input
- **Scroll Navigation**: Browsing through conversation history
- **Expansion Controls**: Ability to expand/collapse the chat interface
- **Command Triggers**: Special characters or buttons to activate commands

### System Interactions

- **AI Integration**: Connection to AI assistant backend for intelligent responses
- **Screen Context**: Awareness of current screen for contextual assistance
- **Data Access**: Secure connection to relevant data sources for information retrieval

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture

- **ChatSystem Container**: Primary wrapper managing layout and state
- **MessageList**: Component for displaying and managing conversation history
- **InputController**: Handles text input, commands, and submissions
- **ThreadManager**: Organizes conversations into logical threads
- **AIIntegration**: Connects to AI services for intelligent assistance

### State Management

- **Conversation State**: Current and historical messages in active threads
- **Input State**: Current text entry and command context
- **Visibility State**: Current expansion/collapse state of the interface

### Data Flow

- Receives context updates from ViewContext for relevance
- Sends messages to and receives from AI and communication services
- Persists conversation history to local or cloud storage

## Usage Guidelines

### Integration

- Should be a direct child of the MainPage component
- Requires ViewContext provider for screen awareness
- Should have appropriate z-index to overlay or sit alongside main content

### Customization

- Supports theming via global theme variables
- Allows configuration of available commands and AI capabilities
- Can be positioned in different locations based on user preference

### Accessibility

- All interactive elements must have appropriate ARIA labels
- Should support keyboard navigation for all functions
- Must provide alternative text for any visual indicators

## Related Components

- **MainPage**: Parent container that hosts the Chat System
- **ViewContext**: Provides information about the currently active view
- **AIService**: Backend service providing intelligent responses
- **UserDirectory**: Service for team member information and status
- **NotificationSystem**: Manages alerts for new messages and mentions

## Technical Considerations

- **Performance**: Message rendering should be optimized for large conversation histories
- **Offline Support**: Should cache recent conversations for offline access
- **Security**: Must implement appropriate controls for sensitive information sharing
- **Synchronization**: Should maintain consistency across multiple devices and sessions
