# Starcom App UI Architecture Overhaul

**Date:** July 6, 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive architectural restructuring of the Starcom App UI. The overhaul aims to create a more modular, intuitive, and scalable interface while preserving the existing functionality.

## Architectural Layers

The new UI architecture consists of three distinct layers:

1. **App Container Layer** (First Level)
   - The top-most container that holds global elements
   - Houses the Header and Pages Container

2. **Page Layer** (Second Level)
   - MainPage - Primary interactive interface
   - SettingsPage - Configuration and preferences
   - (Potential for additional standalone pages in the future)

3. **Screen Layer** (Third Level)
   - Individual functional screens within pages
   - Each screen focuses on a specific capability or feature set

## Navigation Flow

- The **Header** provides global navigation and actions (settings access, account management)
- The **MainBottomBar** (within MainPage) handles navigation between screens
- **Route-based navigation** handles movement between Pages

## Key Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear boundaries between layout, navigation, and functional components
   - Each screen focuses on a specific task or capability

2. **Consistent User Experience**
   - Standardized navigation patterns across the application
   - Unified design language and interaction patterns

3. **Modularity and Extensibility**
   - Easy addition of new screens and features
   - Components can be reused across different parts of the application

4. **Persistent Context**
   - Chat remains available throughout the MainPage experience
   - User context and permissions are maintained across navigation

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation**
   - Create new layout components
   - Establish new navigation structure

2. **Phase 2: Migration**
   - Move existing functionality into the new structure
   - Ensure backward compatibility where necessary

3. **Phase 3: Enhancement**
   - Improve UX with animations and transitions
   - Add additional functionality to new components

4. **Phase 4: Optimization**
   - Performance testing and optimization
   - Accessibility improvements
