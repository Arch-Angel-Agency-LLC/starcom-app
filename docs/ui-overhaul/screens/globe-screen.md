# GlobeScreen

**Layer:** Screen Layer (Third Level)  
**Parent:** MainPage

## Overview

The GlobeScreen is the primary geospatial interface for the Starcom application. It provides an interactive 3D globe visualization with overlays for threat intelligence, network activity, and other spatial data. This screen serves as the main situational awareness dashboard and entry point for geographic exploration.

## Key Components

### HUDLayout
- **Purpose:** Specialized layout for the globe interface
- **Components:**
  - LeftSideBar: Contains tools and controls for globe interaction
  - RightSideBar: Houses contextual information and details
  - Center: Contains the 3D globe visualization
  - Corner Components: Specialized information displays
- **Behavior:**
  - Maintains the spatial relationship between components
  - Adapts to different screen sizes
  - Provides consistent access to tools and information

### 3D Globe Visualization
- **Purpose:** Interactive representation of global data
- **Features:**
  - Real-time data visualization
  - Multiple selectable overlay layers
  - Zoom, rotate, and pan controls
  - Location selection and highlighting
  - Time-based data animation
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - WebGL-based rendering
  - Optimized for performance
  - Support for large datasets
  - Customizable visual styling

### Data Layers
- **Purpose:** Visualize different types of information on the globe
- **Layer Types:**
  - Threat Intelligence
  - Network Activity
  - Weather and Environmental
  - Political Boundaries
  - Custom Data Sets
- **Behavior:**
  - Layers can be toggled individually
  - Layer opacity and appearance can be adjusted
  - Data updates in real-time where applicable

### Event Monitor
- **Purpose:** Track and display events in real-time
- **Features:**
  - Timeline of recent events
  - Filtering by event type and severity
  - Geographic correlation with globe
  - Alert indicators for critical events
- **Behavior:**
  - Updates automatically as new events occur
  - Allows direct navigation to event details
  - Supports manual and automatic refresh

### Control Panels
- **Purpose:** Provide user control over globe functionality
- **Features:**
  - View selection (2D/3D toggle)
  - Layer management
  - Filter controls
  - Search functionality
  - Time period selection
- **Behavior:**
  - Context-sensitive controls based on current state
  - Collapsible panels for space efficiency
  - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## Interaction Model

### Globe Navigation
- **Pan:** Click and drag or arrow keys
- **Zoom:** Mouse wheel, pinch gesture, or +/- keys
- **Rotate:** Right-click and drag or Shift + arrow keys
- **Tilt:** Ctrl + drag or Alt + arrow keys

### Selection and Details
- **Select Location:** Click on map point
- **View Details:** Selected location details appear in RightSideBar
- **Multi-select:** Shift + click for multiple selections
- **Clear Selection:** Esc key or click empty area

### Data Interaction
- **Filter:** Use control panels to filter visible data
- **Search:** Find specific locations or data points
- **Time Control:** Scrub through historical data
- **Layers:** Toggle layers via layer panel

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Implement level of detail (LOD) for globe rendering
- Use efficient data structures for large datasets
- Consider WebWorkers for data processing
- Optimize render cycles and event handling

### Data Management
- Support for both static and real-time data sources
- Efficient loading of geographic data
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- Progressive loading for large datasets

### Integration Points
- Integration with threat intelligence systems
- Connection to real-time event monitoring
- Link to detailed analysis tools
- Export capabilities for reports and sharing
