# AI Agent Screen

**Status:** Planned  
**Parent:** MainPage

## Overview

The AI Agent Screen serves as the command center for managing, training, and deploying AI agents within the Starcom ecosystem. This screen provides users with comprehensive tools to create specialized AI agents for various tasks, monitor their performance, and integrate them into workflows across the application.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Command Center

- **Agent Dashboard**: Overview of all active and available AI agents with status indicators
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time statistics on agent activity, success rates, and resource consumption
- **Global Controls**: Master controls for enabling/disabling agent categories or specific capabilities

### 2. Agent Configuration

- **Agent Builder**: Interface for creating and customizing new AI agents with specific capabilities
- **Parameter Configuration**: Advanced settings for fine-tuning agent behavior and responses
- **Training Module**: Tools for training agents with custom datasets and specialized knowledge

### 3. Deployment Management

- **Assignment Panel**: Interface for assigning agents to specific tasks, cases, or team members
- **Scheduling System**: Calendar-based scheduling for automated agent activities
- **Resource Allocation**: Tools for managing computational resources across multiple active agents

### 4. Agent Interactions

- **Direct Interface**: Communication console for direct interaction with individual agents
- **Batch Instructions**: System for providing instructions to multiple agents simultaneously
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Tools for providing corrective feedback to improve agent performance

### 5. Integration Hub

- **Cross-System Connections**: Management of agent integrations with other screens and systems
- **API Configuration**: Interface for connecting agents to external data sources and services
- **Workflow Designer**: Visual tool for creating automated agent workflows across the platform

## Interactions

### Data Sources
- AI model repositories
- Training datasets
- Performance logging system
- User preference database

### Integration Points
- **NetRunner Screen**: Provides intelligence gathering capabilities to agents
- **Analyzer Screen**: Receives data from agents for advanced analysis

- **CaseManager Screen**: Integrates agent findings into case information

## Technical Specifications

### State Management
- Agent activation states
- Configuration parameters
- Training progress indicators
- Resource allocation metrics

### Data Flows
- Agent instruction streams (bidirectional)
- Training data inputs (inbound)
- Performance metrics (outbound)
- Integration configurations (bidirectional)

## Design Guidelines

### Visual Hierarchy
- Active agents should be prominently displayed
- Critical agent alerts should have visual priority
- Training and configuration options should be logically grouped

### User Experience Considerations
- Clear indication of agent capabilities and limitations
- Intuitive interfaces for complex configuration tasks
- Progressive disclosure of advanced options for different user expertise levels

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
