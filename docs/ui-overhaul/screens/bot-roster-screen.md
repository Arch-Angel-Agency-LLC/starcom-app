# BotRoster Screen

**Status:** Planned  
**Parent:** MainPage

## Overview

The BotRoster Screen serves as the central management interface for all automated agents and bots within the Starcom App ecosystem. This screen enables users to deploy, monitor, and control various types of autonomous agents that perform specialized tasks throughout the application, from data collection to analysis and reporting.

## Core Components

### 1. Bot Dashboard

- **Active Roster**: Grid or list view of all active bots with status indicators and current assignments
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time statistics showing resource usage, task completion rates, and efficiency
- **Health Monitoring**: Visual indicators of operational status, errors, and maintenance requirements

### 2. Bot Configuration

- **Bot Builder**: Interface for creating and customizing new bots with specific capabilities
- **Parameter Editor**: Advanced settings for fine-tuning bot behavior, frequency, and operational parameters
- **Template Library**: Collection of pre-configured bot templates for common use cases

### 3. Deployment Controls

- **Assignment Manager**: Interface for assigning bots to specific tasks, data sources, or operational zones
- **Scheduling System**: Calendar-based scheduling for routine and one-time bot operations
- **Priority Controls**: Tools for managing bot processing priority and resource allocation

### 4. Bot Categories

- **OSINT Bots**: Specialized for open-source intelligence gathering from external sources
- **Analytical Bots**: Focused on processing and analyzing collected data
- **Reporting Bots**: Designed to compile and distribute intelligence reports
- **Monitoring Bots**: Continuously observe specified targets or data streams
- **Integration Bots**: Connect to external systems and APIs to exchange data

### 5. Automation Hub

- **Workflow Designer**: Visual tool for creating multi-bot workflows and process chains
- **Trigger Configuration**: Set up event-based bot activation based on system events or data changes
- **Dependency Manager**: Tools to manage sequencing and dependencies between bot operations

## Interactions

### Data Sources
- Bot configuration database
- Task assignment system
- Resource monitoring services
- Performance logging system

### Integration Points
- **NetRunner Screen**: Receives data from OSINT bots for intelligence gathering
- **Analyzer Screen**: Integrates with analytical bots for data processing
- **AI Agent Screen**: Shares resources and capabilities with AI-powered agents
- **CaseManager Screen**: Assigns bots to specific case-related tasks

## Technical Specifications

### State Management
- Bot activation states
- Task assignment status
- Execution progress indicators
- Error and alert states

### Data Flows
- Configuration updates (inbound)
- Performance metrics (outbound)
- Task assignments (inbound)
- Results and reports (outbound)

## Design Guidelines

### Visual Hierarchy
- Critical alerts and errors should have highest visual priority
- Grouping of bots by category or function
- Clear status indicators with consistent color coding

### User Experience Considerations
- Batch operations for managing multiple bots simultaneously
- Progressive disclosure of advanced configuration options
- Clear feedback on bot operations and task completion

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Implement basic bot dashboard with status monitoring
- Create simplified bot configuration interface
- Develop essential deployment controls

### Phase 2: Advanced Management
- Add detailed performance analytics and health monitoring
- Implement comprehensive configuration capabilities
- Develop scheduling and priority management systems

### Phase 3: Automation and Integration
- Create visual workflow designer for multi-bot processes
- Implement trigger-based automation
- Develop deep integration with other screens and systems

## Related Components

- **MainBottomBar**: Navigation access point to the BotRoster Screen
- **ResourceMonitor**: Tracks computational resources used by active bots
- **NotificationSystem**: Delivers bot-related alerts and updates
- **GlobalHeader**: Contains bot status summary indicators

## Technical Considerations

- **Scalability**: The system should support hundreds of concurrent bots without performance degradation
- **Fault Tolerance**: Bots should have automatic recovery mechanisms and failure reporting
- **Resource Management**: Dynamic allocation of system resources based on bot priority and workload
- **Security**: Strict permission controls for bot creation and deployment to prevent unauthorized use
