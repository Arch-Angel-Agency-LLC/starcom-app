# NetRunner Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the remaining implementation tasks to complete the NetRunner system redesign. The core components have been designed and implemented, but several integration points need to be completed to make the system fully functional.

## Current Status
- Power Tools: Designed and implemented with a comprehensive list of OSINT tools
- Bot Roster: UI components implemented, integration points identified
- Intel Analyzer: Report builder implemented, needs backend integration
- Intel Marketplace: UI designed, requires blockchain integration
- Monitoring System: Dashboard and UI components implemented, needs backend services

## Next Steps by Component
