# State Management Issues Fix for Marquee

## Problem Analysis

The marquee has state management issues where:

1. **Auto-scroll doesn't start by default**
2. **After drag/easing completes, marquee resets to 0 instead of resuming natural flow**
3. **Two separate offset systems fight each other**: `scrollOffset` vs `autoScrollOffset`

## Root Cause

The current implementation has two disconnected offset systems:
- `scrollOffset`: Used during drag/easing
- `autoScrollOffset`: Used during auto-scroll

When transitioning between states, we lose continuity.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a unified offset system where:
1. **Single source of truth**: One primary offset that accumulates over time
2. **State continuity**: Drag interactions modify the existing auto-scroll position
3. **Natural flow**: After easing, auto-scroll resumes from the current position
4. **Proper initialization**: Auto-scroll starts immediately when content is available

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Unified Offset**: Replace dual offset system with single accumulated offset
2. **Position Continuity**: When drag starts, capture current auto-scroll position
3. **Seamless Resume**: When easing completes, auto-scroll continues from final position
4. **Proper Initialization**: Ensure auto-scroll starts immediately on component mount

This will eliminate the jumping behavior and provide smooth, continuous marquee operation.
