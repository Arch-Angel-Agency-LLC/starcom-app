- Type safety for strings/numbers
- Fallback rendering for invalid data
- Progressive loading enhancement

✅ **Rendering Safety**
- Content width measurement with fallbacks
- CSS transform value validation
- Class name safety checks
- Style property validation

## Enhanced Recovery Systems

### Performance Recovery
- **Degraded Mode**: Simplified physics for 10 seconds during performance issues
- **Memory Monitoring**: 50MB heap size threshold with cleanup
- **Animation Termination**: Automatic stopping of problematic animations
- **Progressive Recovery**: Gradual restoration of full functionality

## Monitoring & Detection

### Real-Time Monitoring
