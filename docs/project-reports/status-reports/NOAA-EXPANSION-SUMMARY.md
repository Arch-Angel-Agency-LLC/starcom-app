## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### Priority-Based Data Access
```typescript
// Fetch only critical data
const primaryData = await provider.fetchPrimaryData();

// Fetch all available data
const allData = await provider.fetchAllData();

provider.subscribeToPrimaryData((key, data) => {
  handleRealtimeUpdate(key, data);
});
```
