## üö® **CRITICAL FINDINGS**

### **Deploy Blocker Issues (Production Stoppers):**

#### **1. PQC Authentication Mock Implementation** üî¥
- **Issue**: Authentication uses mock DID verification and simulated quantum crypto
- **Location**: `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - `const mockDID = \`did:socom:${walletAddress.slice(0, 8)}\``
- **Impact**: No real quantum resistance in authentication layer
- **Remediation**: Replace with real DID registry and liboqs integration

#### **2. Quantum-Classical Hybrid Missing** üî¥  
- **Issue**: Hybrid cryptography exists only in backup/legacy files
- **Location**: Production uses incomplete `SOCOMPQCryptoService`
- **Impact**: Platform lacks quantum resistance in encrypted operations
- **Remediation**: Migrate and activate hybrid crypto from legacy backup

#### **3. Nostr Protocol Implementation Gap** üî¥
- **Issue**: Demo interface with simulated functionality, no real protocol
- **Location**: `src/services/nostrService.ts` - missing WebSocket relay connections
- **Impact**: Communication system completely non-functional
- **Remediation**: Implement real Nostr protocol with WebSocket relays

#### **4. Cross-Service Key Management Missing** üî¥
- **Issue**: No unified key management across services
- **Location**: AuthContext, IPFS, Nostr manage keys independently
- **Impact**: Key inconsistencies, authentication failures
- **Remediation**: Build unified quantum key manager

#### **5. FIPS 140-2 Validation Missing** üî¥
- **Issue**: No formal cryptographic validation
- **Location**: All cryptographic modules
- **Impact**: Government deployment blocked
- **Remediation**: Obtain FIPS Level 3+ validation

### **Security Domain Scores:**
| Domain | Current | Target | Gap | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|-----|--------|
| Authentication | 65/100 | 95/100 | 30 | üî¥ Critical |
| Cryptographic Core | 58/100 | 98/100 | 40 | üî¥ Critical |
| Network/Communications | 45/100 | 90/100 | 45 | üî¥ Critical |
| Data Storage (IPFS) | 78/100 | 90/100 | 12 | üü° Good |
| Integration Security | 42/100 | 95/100 | 53 | üî¥ Critical |
| Compliance | 55/100 | 98/100 | 43 | üî¥ Critical |
| Testing/Validation | 62/100 | 85/100 | 23 | üü° Needs Work |
