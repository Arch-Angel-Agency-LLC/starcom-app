## üéØ Current Status

### **‚úÖ COMPLETED**
- [x] **Architecture Specification**: Complete AI Security RelayNode design
- [x] **Deprecation of Old Approach**: Multi-tier strategy marked as superseded
- [x] **Updated Refactor Plan**: Main documentation updated to reflect new direction
- [x] **Technical Analysis**: All prior research consolidated into unified approach

### **üîÑ IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] **Phase 1 Implementation**: Core Rust backend development (Starting now)

### **üìã PENDING**
- [ ] **Phase 2-5**: Service integration, dApp integration, distribution, production

## üîÑ Migration from Multi-Tier Strategy

### **What Changed**

| Old Multi-Tier Approach | New AI Security RelayNode |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| ‚ùå 4 different tiers/modes | ‚úÖ Single application mode |
| ‚ùå Browser-only, Extension, Local, WASM | ‚úÖ Local relay node + fallback |
| ‚ùå Complex progressive enhancement | ‚úÖ Simple binary choice |
| ‚ùå Multiple codepaths to maintain | ‚úÖ One primary implementation |
| ‚ùå User confusion about options | ‚úÖ Clear value proposition |
| ‚ùå Partial solutions at each tier | ‚úÖ Complete solution in one package |

### **What Stayed the Same**
- ‚úÖ **Real-time WebSocket performance** for teams that install the relay node
- ‚úÖ **Fallback to public relays** for users who don't install it
- ‚úÖ **Team independence** and decentralization goals
- ‚úÖ **Quantum-safe security** throughout the system
- ‚úÖ **Nostr + IPFS integration** for communication and storage
- ‚úÖ **Serverless dApp deployment** on Vercel/similar platforms

### **Why This Is Better**
1. **Simpler to Build**: One Rust application instead of four different transport layers
2. **Simpler to Use**: Download one app vs. choosing between four options
3. **Better UX**: Clear before/after comparison (public vs. local relay performance)
4. **Focused Value**: "Get both Nostr relay AND IPFS node in one download"
5. **Lower Maintenance**: Single codebase for the enhanced experience

- Team-based access control
- Service discovery and health monitoring
- Performance optimization and reliability

### **Phase 3: dApp Integration**

**Goal**: Update the Starcom dApp to detect and use local RelayNode services.

**Key Components**:
- Adaptive relay service detection
- Real-time feature enablement
- Installation promotion and guidance
- Seamless fallback to public relays

## üìã Technical Implementation Tasks

### **Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)**

1. **Set up Rust project structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir ai-security-relaynode
   cd ai-security-relaynode
   cargo init --lib
   cargo add tauri tokio serde serde_json
   ```

2. **Initialize Tauri application**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli
   cargo tauri init
   ```

3. **Create basic service modules**
   - `src/nostr_relay.rs` - Basic Nostr relay implementation
   - `src/ipfs_node.rs` - Basic IPFS node implementation
   - `src/security_layer.rs` - Unified security interface
   - `src/api_gateway.rs` - HTTP API for dApp integration

4. **Build minimal UI**
   - Service status dashboard
   - Team configuration form
   - Basic installation guidance

### **Dependencies to Add**

```toml
# Cargo.toml dependencies for Phase 1
[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "1.0", features = ["api-all"] }
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
tokio-tungstenite = "0.20"
axum = "0.7"
libp2p = "0.53"
nostr = "0.24"
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4"] }
```

### **Development Environment Setup**

```bash
# Install Rust and Tauri CLI
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli

# Install platform-specific dependencies
# macOS
xcode-select --install

# Windows
# Install Visual Studio Build Tools

# Linux
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    wget \
    libssl-dev \
    libgtk-3-dev \
    libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
