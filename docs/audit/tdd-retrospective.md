## Retrospective: Team Collaboration Flow

- **Date**: 2025-07-02
- **Milestone**: Team Collaboration Flow (Context, Dashboard, and Intel Pages)

### What Went Well
- Tests-first approach ensured `useTeams` hook and `TeamContext` provider implemented correctly.
- Comprehensive unit tests for `TeamDashboard` caught edge cases early.
- Integration tests for `TeamIntelPage` validated access control (member vs non-member).
- TDD process guide and test templates streamlined writing new tests.
- CI integration ran tests and schema validation automatically, preventing regressions.

### What Blocked Us
- Initial stub of `AnchorService` lacked clear initialization pattern leading to mock inconsistencies.
- IPFS orchestrator stub needed additional methods to fully simulate uploads in tests.
- Navigation routes not fully wired, causing some tests to fail until corrected.
- Linting errors in service stubs required quick fixes to satisfy CI.

### Action Items
1. Refine `AnchorService` initialization pattern for test and production parity. (Owner: @dev-alice)
2. Extend `IPFSContentOrchestrator` stub to include package upload validation. (Owner: @dev-bob)
3. Complete and verify navigation entries in `routes.tsx` for all team pages. (Owner: @dev-praveen)
4. Run linting (`npm run lint`) across service stubs and resolve outstanding errors. (Owner: @dev-charlie)
5. Schedule follow-up TDD session to onboard new team members on writing integration tests. (Owner: @team-lead)
