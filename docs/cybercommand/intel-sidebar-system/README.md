# CyberCommand Intel Sidebar System Documentation

**Project:** Starcom App - CyberCommand Intelligence Interface  
**Date:** August 3, 2025  
**Status:** Design & MVP Planning Phase  

## 📋 Overview

This documentation covers the design, planning, and implementation of the CyberCommand Intel Sidebar System - a comprehensive interface for intelligence collection, analysis, and reporting within the Starcom App's 3D globe environment.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Populate CyberCommandLeftSideBar** with Intel collection and monitoring controls
- **Populate CyberCommandRightSideBar** with Intel analysis and operations tools
- **Create seamless Intel filing workflow** for users
- **Provide authentic value** through real-time intelligence management
- **Leverage existing systems** (IntelDashboardPopup, VisualizationModeInterface)

- ✅ **PopupManager** - Z-index 10000 highest layer system
- ✅ **Intel Classification System** - Removed security theater
- 🟡 **Sidebar Content** - Ready for population
- 🔄 **MVP Development** - In planning phase

## 🧭 Next Steps

1. **Review MVP Analysis** - Understand implementation priorities
2. **Start with Recent Intel Reports Panel** - Left sidebar MVP component
3. **Implement Globe Integration** - Click interactions with sidebars
4. **Build Analysis Tools** - Right sidebar intelligence workspace

## 📊 Key Metrics for Success

- **User Engagement**: Time spent in Intel interface
- **Report Creation**: Number of reports filed per session
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Clicks required for complete Intel workflow
- **Data Quality**: Accuracy and completeness of filed reports
