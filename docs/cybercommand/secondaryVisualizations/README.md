## Implementation Status Summary

### Currently Working ✅
- **IntelReports**: Fully functional with 3D models, settings panel, and Globe integration
- **Mode Switching**: All 5 modes are selectable via the visualization controls
- **Settings Framework**: Base settings panel structure exists for all modes

### Needs Implementation ⚠️
- **NetworkInfrastructure**: Visualization logic and data integration
- **CyberThreats**: Threat intelligence feeds and heat map visualization
- **CommHubs**: Communication facility display and coverage areas
- **CyberAttacks**: Real-time attack streams and animation system

## Technical Architecture

### Shared Components
```
src/context/VisualizationModeContext.tsx - Mode state management
src/components/HUD/Settings/CyberCommandSettings/ - Settings panels
src/components/Globe/Globe.tsx - 3D rendering engine
src/hooks/useCyberCommandSettings.ts - Settings persistence
```

### Mode-Specific Implementation Pattern
Each secondary visualization follows this pattern:
1. **Data Integration**: Specific data sources and APIs
2. **3D Visualization**: Globe rendering logic and 3D models
3. **Settings Panel**: Mode-specific configuration options
4. **User Interaction**: Click handlers and detail displays
5. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering and data management

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Immediate)
1. **CyberAttacks**: Real-time attack visualization (VERY HIGH priority)
2. **CyberThreats**: Threat intelligence integration (HIGH priority)

### Phase 2: Network Analysis (Near-term)
3. **NetworkInfrastructure**: Infrastructure topology visualization (MEDIUM priority)
4. **CommHubs**: Communication facility analysis (MEDIUM-HIGH priority)

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Long-term)
- Advanced analytics and correlation across all modes
- Cross-mode data relationships and analysis
- Predictive modeling and AI-assisted analysis

## Data Integration Strategy

### Common Data Sources
- **Geographic Databases**: Country boundaries, city locations, infrastructure
- **Threat Intelligence**: Commercial and open source threat feeds
- **Real-time Streams**: Attack data, network status, communication traffic
- **Government Sources**: Declassified intelligence and public safety data

### API Integration Requirements
- Rate limiting and caching for external APIs
- Real-time data streaming capabilities
- Fallback mechanisms for API unavailability
- Data normalization and quality assurance

## User Experience Design

### Consistent Interaction Patterns
- **Click for Details**: All visualizations support click-to-investigate
- **Filter Controls**: Consistent filtering across all modes
- **Settings Persistence**: User preferences saved across sessions
- **Performance Optimization**: Smooth interactions regardless of data volume

### Mode Switching Experience
- **Instant Mode Changes**: No loading delays when switching modes
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of active mode
- **Data Continuity**: Maintain context when switching between related modes
- **Progressive Loading**: Show basic data first, enhance with detail

## Testing Strategy

### Per-Mode Testing
- [ ] Data loading and parsing validation
- [ ] 3D visualization accuracy and performance
- [ ] Settings panel functionality
- [ ] User interaction responsiveness

### Cross-Mode Integration Testing
- [ ] Mode switching performance
- [ ] Data correlation accuracy
- [ ] Settings persistence across modes
- [ ] Performance under load

### User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Cyber intelligence analyst workflows
- [ ] Network security team usage patterns
- [ ] Incident response team integration
- [ ] Training and onboarding effectiveness

## Security Considerations

### Data Classification
- **Public Data**: Open source intelligence and public infrastructure
- **Sensitive Data**: Commercial threat intelligence and network topology
- **Classified Data**: Government intelligence and restricted facility information
- **Operational Data**: Real-time attack and response information

### Access Controls
- Role-based access to different visualization modes
- Data masking for unauthorized users
- Audit trails for sensitive data access
- Secure storage and transmission of intelligence data

## Performance Requirements

### Real-time Constraints
- **Attack Visualization**: < 5 second latency for real-time attacks
- **Mode Switching**: < 200ms transition time between modes
- **Data Updates**: Smooth updates without interface freezing
- **Memory Usage**: < 2GB RAM for full dataset visualization

### Scalability Targets
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 100+ simultaneous analysts
- **Data Volume**: Handle millions of data points per mode
- **Geographic Coverage**: Global coverage with regional detail
- **Temporal Range**: Historical data going back 5+ years
