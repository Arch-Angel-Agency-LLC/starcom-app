# 12 - Future Extensions

## Planned
- International Adapters (ESA, JMA, NRCAN) via same interface.
- TEC (Total Electron Content) layer integration with shared LOD infrastructure.
- Magnetometer chain assimilation for modeled induced currents.
- Satellite conjunction correlation (field anomalies vs satellite trajectory).
- Provenance anchoring (on-chain hash commitments).
- Flow field + streamline animations (temporal interpolation).

## Exploratory
- Machine-learned anomaly detection (temporal autoencoders).
- Predictive storm impact modeling combining Kp, Dst, electric fields.
- Infrastructure risk scoring (grid overlay with asset registry).
- Multi-user collaborative annotations on anomaly clusters.

## Potential Research Topics
- Adaptive LOD driven by information entropy vs camera distance only.
- Hybrid CPU/GPU spatial aggregation (compute shaders).
- Probabilistic confidence layers (ensemble source weighting).

## Sunset / Deprecation Targets
- Legacy direct hook pipeline after Phase 3 parity confirmed.
- Regex-only directory scraping once provider manifest endpoints added.

## Integration Opportunities
- Intel Report auto-generation from high-severity sequences.
- Alert webhooks / external notifications.

## Metrics for Adoption
- Mean time from new adapter prototype to production (<2 days target).
- % of sessions using pipeline vs legacy (goal 100% post Phase 3).
