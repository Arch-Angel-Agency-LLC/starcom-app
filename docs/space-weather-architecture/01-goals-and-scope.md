# 01 - Goals & Scope

## Primary Objective
Establish a modular, future-proof Space Weather platform inside Starcom that ingests, normalizes, evaluates, and visualizes global electromagnetic environment data (initially NOAA InterMag + US-Canada Electric Field) with an architecture ready for multi-agency expansion.

## Core Goals
1. Accuracy & Unit Integrity (mV/km canonical for electric fields).
2. Multi-source Extensibility (plug adapters without rewiring pipeline).
3. Performance at Scale (100k+ vectors, adaptive LOD, GPU instancing).
4. Data Quality Transparency (scores, coverage, freshness, anomalies).
5. Temporal Analytics (snapshot ring buffer, playback, deltas).
6. Alert Coherence (percentile + absolute hybrid, regional clustering).
7. Operator Trust (provenance metadata, reproducible transformations).
8. Seamless UX (controlled layer toggles, per-source differentiation, debug telemetry).

## Out of Scope (Now)
- Full international source integration (ESA, JMA, etc.) — only placeholder adapter scaffolds.
- Predictive ML modeling — reserved for later phase.
- Persistent backend database beyond in-memory + optional cache layer.

## Success Criteria (Initial Release / Phase 0–1)
- Dual dataset (InterMag + US-Canada) rendered with clear per-source legend.
- Unit-correct magnitudes and thresholds; user can toggle raw vs normalized view.
- Pipeline interface & SourceAdapter abstraction merged, legacy fetch path behind flag.
- Diagnostic overlay (counts: raw, filtered, sampled, rendered) visible in debug mode.

## Non-Functional Requirements
| Category | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Latency | <2s cold load for first snapshot under typical network |
| Frame Impact | <4ms additional render budget at 5k rendered vectors |
| Memory | <50MB incremental for 24 snapshot buffer at 5k vectors each |
| Reliability | Graceful degradation on one-source failure without UI freeze |
| Observability | Console + optional HUD metrics (coverage %, loss %, age) |

## Stakeholders
- Visualization/UX team (globe layers).
- Intelligence/Analytics pipeline (consuming anomalies & alerts).
- Future Data Integration team (international expansion).

## Guiding Principles
- Prefer explicit metadata to implicit heuristics.
- Fail with stale-but-valid data over empty visualization.
- Make sampling deterministic & inspectable.
- Separate concerns: ingest vs normalize vs enrich vs render.
