# Intelligence System Architecture

## Overview

The STARCOM Intelligence System implements a sophisticated, multi-layered approach to data collection, processing, analysis, and reporting. This architecture supports both linear processing pipelines and complex non-linear analytical workflows.

## Core Concepts

### Data Processing Philosophy

The system distinguishes between different types of data based on their processing state and analytical value:

1. **Raw Collection** - Unprocessed data from collection systems
2. **Structured Extraction** - Meaningful data points extracted from raw sources
3. **Analytical Correlation** - Patterns and relationships identified across data points
4. **Intelligence Synthesis** - Correlated information with analytical context
5. **Report Generation** - Finished intelligence products for dissemination

### Key Data Types

- **RawData**: Unprocessed collection artifacts (HTML, JSON, certificates, etc.)
- **Artifacts**: Discrete evidence objects with integrity tracking
- **Signals**: Detected patterns or anomalies in data
- **Observations**: Extracted meaningful data points (emails, IPs, domains)
- **Patterns**: Recurring structures identified across multiple observations
- **Evidence**: Analytically or legally significant data points
- **Indicators**: Signs pointing to specific conditions or threats
- **Intelligence**: Correlated information with reliability assessments
- **Findings**: Specific discoveries or analytical conclusions
- **IntelReports**: Finished intelligence products for dissemination

## Data Flow Models

### Linear Processing Pipeline

```
NetRunner Collection → RawData → Observations → Intelligence → IntelReports
```

This represents the basic flow from collection to reporting, suitable for:
- Automated processing workflows
- Real-time threat detection
- Standardized report generation

### Non-Linear Analysis Network

```
RawData ←→ Artifacts ←→ Signals
    ↓         ↓         ↓
Observations ←→ Patterns ←→ Evidence
    ↓         ↓         ↓
Intelligence ←→ Indicators ←→ Findings
    ↓         ↓         ↓
        IntelReports
```

This supports:
- Complex analytical workflows
- Cross-validation of findings
- Iterative hypothesis refinement
- Multi-source data fusion

## System Layers

### Collection Layer
- **RawData**: Direct collection from NetRunner, APIs, sensors
- **Artifacts**: Files, certificates, logs, configurations
- **Signals**: Anomalies, signatures, behavioral patterns

### Processing Layer
- **Observations**: Extracted entities (emails, IPs, technologies)
- **Patterns**: Recurring structures across data
- **Evidence**: Significant data with chain of custody

### Analysis Layer
- **Intelligence**: Correlated data with reliability ratings
- **Indicators**: Threat/opportunity indicators
- **Findings**: Analytical conclusions

### Reporting Layer
- **IntelReports**: Finished intelligence products
- **Dissemination**: Controlled distribution and access

## Component Integration

### NetRunner → Intel Flow

NetRunner's WebsiteScanner produces RawData that gets transformed into multiple data types:

```typescript
// NetRunner Output → RawData
{
  id: "raw-001",
  sourceUrl: "https://target.com",
  collectionMethod: "web-scrape",
  content: "<html>...</html>",
  contentType: "html"
}

// Extracted → Observations
{
  id: "obs-001", 
  type: "email",
  value: "admin@target.com",
  extractedFrom: "raw-001",
  confidence: 85
}

// Correlated → Intelligence
{
  id: "intel-001",
  source: "OSINT",
  reliability: "C",
  data: "admin@target.com",
  derivedFrom: { observations: ["obs-001"] }
}
```

### IntelAnalyzer Processing

The IntelAnalyzer takes Intelligence objects and produces:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring structures
- **Entity Extraction**: Discovers relationships between data points
- **Threat Assessment**: Evaluates security implications
- **Report Generation**: Creates finished intelligence products

## Quality Assurance

### Reliability Ratings
- **A**: Completely reliable
- **B**: Usually reliable  
- **C**: Fairly reliable
- **D**: Not usually reliable
- **E**: Unreliable
- **F**: Reliability cannot be judged
- **X**: Deliberate deception suspected

### Confidence Scoring
- Numerical confidence scores (0-100) for all extracted data
- Confidence propagation through processing layers
- Confidence decay over time for temporal data

### Data Lineage
- Complete tracking of data transformations
- Source attribution for all intelligence products
- Chain of custody for evidence items

## Classification and Handling

### Classification Levels
- **UNCLASS**: Unclassified information
- **CONFIDENTIAL**: Confidential information
- **SECRET**: Secret information  
- **TOP_SECRET**: Top Secret information

### Dissemination Controls
- Access control based on clearance levels
- Need-to-know restrictions
- Time-based access limitations
- Geographic distribution controls

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for collection systems
- Distributed processing for analysis workflows
