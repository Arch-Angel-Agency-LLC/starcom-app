## 📝 OUTSTANDING ITEMS (5% Minor Cleanup)

The following items were identified during Phase 5 testing but do not impact core functionality:

### **Low Priority Cleanup** (Optional Future Work)
1. IntelligenceWorkflowEngine.ts - 7 remaining Intelligence[] references
2. Event emitter interface harmonization opportunities
3. Property reference optimizations in Validators.ts
4. Minor transformer enhancements

These items represent **architectural polish** rather than functional requirements and can be addressed in future maintenance cycles.
