## **üéØ Key Architectural Decisions**

### **Decision 1: CyberCommand System Protection**
**Date**: July 9, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Problem**: Need to ensure CyberCommand Globe HUD system is never modified during consolidation.

**Decision**: 
- Rename all CyberCommand HUD components with "CyberCommand" prefix
- Establish absolute rule: NO modifications to any CyberCommand components
- All new applications must be standalone only

**Implementation**:
- `HUDLayout` ‚Üí `CyberCommandHUDLayout`
- `CenterViewManager` ‚Üí `CyberCommandCenterManager`
- All bars and corners renamed with CyberCommand prefix
- Updated all imports and references
- Documentation clearly marks these as off-limits

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Zero risk of accidentally breaking CyberCommand system
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Clear separation of concerns
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Neutral**: Slightly longer component names

### **Decision 2: Standalone Application Architecture**
**Date**: July 9, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **DECIDED** | üîÑ **IMPLEMENTATION PENDING**

**Problem**: How should new applications integrate with the existing system?

**Evaluated Options**:
1. **Embed in CyberCommand HUD** - ‚ùå **REJECTED** (violates protection rule)
2. **Hybrid HUD/Standalone** - ‚ùå **REJECTED** (too complex, breaks separation)
3. **Standalone Applications Only** - ‚úÖ **SELECTED**

**Decision**: All new applications run as completely independent standalone applications

**Implementation Plan**:
- Enhanced ApplicationRouter to handle standalone app navigation
- Each application has its own layout and navigation
- Applications communicate via shared context/services only
- No visual or layout dependencies between applications

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Complete separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Each app can have optimal UX for its purpose
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Easier testing and maintenance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Neutral**: Need enhanced routing infrastructure

### **Decision 3: 7-Application Target Structure**
**Date**: Previous phases  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**

**Applications**:
1. **CyberCommand** - Protected 3D Globe interface
2. **NetRunner** - Investigation and search tools
3. **IntelAnalyzer** - Intelligence analysis and reporting
4. **TimeMap** - Temporal analysis and timelines
5. **NodeWeb** - Network topology and relationships
6. **TeamWorkspace** - Collaboration and team management
7. **MarketExchange** - Economic analysis and market intelligence

**Rationale**: Optimal balance between feature grouping and maintainability

### **Decision 4: Enhanced ApplicationRouter Design**
**Date**: July 9, 2025  
**Status**: üîÑ **DESIGNED** | ‚è≥ **IMPLEMENTATION PENDING**

**Requirements**:
- Support standalone application presentation modes
- Dynamic route registration for applications
- Context preservation across navigation
- Deep linking and URL-based navigation
- Performance optimization for large applications

**Design Principles**:
- No dependencies on CyberCommand HUD components
- Lazy loading for performance
- Modular and extensible architecture
- Clear separation between routing and presentation

---

### **Decision 5: Legacy Component Migration Strategy**
**Date**: July 9, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **STRATEGY DEFINED** | üîÑ **EXECUTION IN PROGRESS**

**Approach**:
1. **Catalog** all remaining legacy components
2. **Analyze** dependencies and complexity
3. **Migrate** components to appropriate new applications
4. **Update** all imports and references
5. **Remove** legacy directories once empty

**Migration Priorities**:
1. **High Value, Low Risk** - Simple components with clear target applications
2. **High Value, High Risk** - Complex components requiring careful refactoring
3. **Low Value** - Consider deprecation instead of migration
