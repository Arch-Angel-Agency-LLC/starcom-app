# 📋 **Starcom App Page Consolidation - Master Plan**

## **🎯 Project Overview**

**Objective**: Consolidate 15+ legacy pages into 7 focused applications for better organization, performance, and maintainability.

**Status**: ✅ **Phase 1 Complete** | 🔄 **Phase 2 Ready to Begin**

---

## **🏗️ Target Application Structure**

### **The 7 Consolidated Applications**

1. **🌐 CyberCommand** - 3D Globe interface with cyberpunk HUD
   - **Status**: ✅ **Protected & Renamed** - DO NOT MODIFY
   - **Purpose**: Geospatial intelligence, threat visualization
   - **Components**: CyberCommandHUDLayout, CyberCommandCenterManager, etc.

2. **🕵️ NetRunner** - Advanced investigation and search tools
   - **Status**: ✅ **Phase 1 Complete** - Basic migration done
   - **Purpose**: OSINT, entity extraction, advanced search workflows

3. **📊 IntelAnalyzer** - Intelligence analysis and reporting
   - **Status**: 🔄 **Phase 2 Target** - Needs full implementation
   - **Purpose**: Data analysis, report generation, intelligence workflows

4. **🗓️ TimeMap** - Temporal analysis and timeline management
   - **Status**: 🔄 **Phase 2 Target** - Needs full implementation
   - **Purpose**: Timeline analysis, temporal correlation, event mapping

5. **🕸️ NodeWeb** - Network topology and relationship mapping
   - **Status**: 🔄 **Phase 2 Target** - Needs full implementation
   - **Purpose**: Network analysis, relationship visualization, entity mapping

6. **👥 TeamWorkspace** - Collaboration and team management
   - **Status**: 🔄 **Phase 2 Target** - Needs full implementation
   - **Purpose**: Team coordination, secure chat, collaborative workspaces

7. **💰 MarketExchange** - Economic analysis and market intelligence
   - **Status**: ✅ **Phase 1 Complete** - Basic structure created
   - **Purpose**: Market analysis, economic intelligence, trading insights

## **🚨 CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS**

### **CyberCommand System is OFF-LIMITS**
- ❌ **DO NOT MODIFY**: Any CyberCommand components (renamed with CyberCommand prefix)
- ❌ **NO INTEGRATION**: New applications must be STANDALONE only
- ❌ **NO EMBEDDING**: Nothing embeds within the Globe's HUD system

### **Standalone Application Rule**
- ✅ **All new applications run independently**
- ✅ **Use enhanced ApplicationRouter for navigation**
- ✅ **No dependencies on CyberCommand HUD components**

---

## **📊 Current Status Summary**

### **✅ Completed Work**
- **Phase 1 Legacy Cleanup**: Removed simple screen wrappers
- **NetRunner Migration**: Moved components to `/src/applications/netrunner/`
- **Basic Application Structure**: Created all 7 application directories
- **CyberCommand Protection**: Renamed all HUD components with CyberCommand prefix
- **Build Integrity**: System builds successfully after all changes

### **🔄 Phase 2 Ready**
- **Infrastructure**: Enhanced ApplicationRouter designed (not yet implemented)
- **Strategy**: Standalone-only approach confirmed
- **Legacy Analysis**: All remaining legacy components catalogued
- **Migration Plans**: Component migration strategies documented

### **📋 Next Steps**
1. **Implement Enhanced ApplicationRouter** - Support for standalone applications
2. **Build Advanced Applications** - IntelAnalyzer, TimeMap, NodeWeb, TeamWorkspace
3. **Migrate Remaining Components** - Move legacy components to new applications
4. **Phase 3 Cleanup** - Remove all remaining legacy files
