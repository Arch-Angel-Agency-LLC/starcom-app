### **Routing Configuration Updates**
```typescript
// src/routes/applicationRoutes.tsx
const applicationRoutes = [
  {
    path: '/command/*',
    element: <CyberCommandApp />,
    children: [
      { path: '', element: <CommandCenterScreen /> },
      { path: 'profile', element: <ProfileScreen /> },
      { path: 'settings', element: <SettingsScreen /> }
    ]
  },
  {
    path: '/netrunner/*',
    element: <NetRunnerApp />,
    children: [
      { path: '', element: <OperationsCenterScreen /> },
      { path: 'search', element: <OSINTSearchScreen /> },
      { path: 'collections', element: <CollectionManagementScreen /> }
    ]
  },
  {
    path: '/analyzer/*',
    element: <IntelAnalyzerApp />,
    children: [
      { path: '', element: <AnalysisDashboardScreen /> },
      { path: 'reports', element: <ReportManagementScreen /> },
      { path: 'reports/:reportId', element: <ReportViewerScreen /> }
    ]
  }
];
```

### **Shared State Management**
```typescript
// src/shared/services/globalStateService.ts
interface GlobalState {
  user: User;
  currentApplication: string;
  navigationHistory: string[];
  notifications: Notification[];
  searchContext: SearchContext;
}

class GlobalStateService {
  // Manage state across applications
  // Handle navigation context
  // Coordinate notifications
  // Manage user preferences
}
```

## **⚠️ Risk Management**

### **Identified Risks**
1. **Migration complexity** - Large components may be difficult to migrate cleanly
2. **User workflow disruption** - Users may struggle to find familiar functionality
3. **Performance regression** - Consolidated applications might be slower
4. **Integration complexity** - Data flow between applications may be complex

### **Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Incremental migration** - Move functionality gradually with thorough testing
2. **Progressive disclosure** - Implement onboarding and feature discovery aids
3. **Performance monitoring** - Continuous benchmarking throughout development
4. **Simplified integration** - Use well-defined interfaces between applications

### **Rollback Plan**
- **Maintain legacy pages** in parallel during Phase 1
- **Feature flags** to switch between old and new implementations
- **Data migration scripts** to revert changes if necessary
- **User preference** to choose between old and new interfaces
