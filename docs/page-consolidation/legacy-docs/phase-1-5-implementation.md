- 🔍 **Legacy TeamWorkspace** - Various team management components scattered across `/src/pages/`
- 🔍 **HUD Dependencies** - Integration points between standalone pages and HUD system

---

## **🔍 Phase 1.5 Investigation Tasks**

### **Task 1: Legacy Directory Deep Scan** (Day 1)

#### **Directories to Analyze**:
```
/src/pages/
├── CaseManager/          # Case management system
├── Cases/               # Case-related components  
├── Demo/                # Demo/testing components
├── InfoAnalysis/        # Information analysis tools
├── InfoGathering/       # Information gathering suite
├── Intel/               # Intel reports and dashboard
├── Investigations/      # Investigation management
├── MainPage/           # MainPage wrapper and remaining screens
├── MyTeams/            # Team management
├── OSINT/              # OSINT dashboard and tools
├── PowerHunt/          # Power hunting tools
├── Reports/            # Report management
├── Screens/            # Legacy screen components
├── SettingsPage/       # Settings management
├── TeamIntel/          # Team intelligence
└── Teams/              # Team collaboration
```

#### **Analysis Goals**:
- **Component Inventory**: Catalog all components and their current usage
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify inter-component dependencies
- **HUD Integration**: Determine current HUD vs. standalone routing
- **Migration Complexity**: Assess effort required for consolidation

### **Task 2: HUD System Integration Analysis** (Day 2)

#### **HUD Architecture Review**:
- **CenterViewManager**: Current view switching mechanism
- **Routing Context**: How views are selected and managed
- **Standalone vs. Embedded**: Routing differences between approaches
- **Legacy Integration**: How current pages integrate with HUD

#### **Key Integration Points**:
```typescript
// CenterViewManager view modes
type ViewMode = 'globe' | 'teams' | 'ai-agent' | 'bots' | 'node-web' | 'investigations' | 'intel';

// Current lazy-loaded components in HUD
const IntelDashboard = lazy(() => import('../../../pages/Intel/IntelDashboard'));
const OSINTDashboard = lazy(() => import('../../../pages/OSINT/OSINTDashboard'));
```

#### **Analysis Questions**:
- Should remaining pages be HUD-integrated or standalone?
- How does routing work between MainPage/HUD and standalone pages?
- What are the navigation patterns and user experience implications?
- Where should consolidated applications live in the routing hierarchy?

### **Task 3: Routing Strategy Decision Matrix** (Day 3)

#### **Routing Approaches to Evaluate**:

##### **Option A: Full HUD Integration**
- **Approach**: Migrate all functionality into HUD CenterViewManager
- **Pros**: Unified interface, consistent navigation, real-time HUD context
- **Cons**: Complex migration, potential performance impact, limited screen real estate

##### **Option B: Hybrid Standalone + HUD**
- **Approach**: Keep specialized tools as standalone pages, basic views in HUD
- **Pros**: Flexible UI, dedicated screen space for complex tools, easier migration
- **Cons**: Fragmented user experience, complex navigation, context switching

##### **Option C: Enhanced Application Router**
- **Approach**: Extend ApplicationRouter to handle both HUD and standalone routing
- **Pros**: Unified routing logic, flexible presentation, scalable architecture
- **Cons**: More complex implementation, requires new routing abstractions

#### **Decision Criteria**:
- **User Experience**: Navigation flow and context preservation
- **Development Complexity**: Implementation and maintenance effort  
- **Performance Impact**: Loading, memory usage, and responsiveness
- **Scalability**: Future feature additions and modifications
- **Integration**: How well it works with existing HUD architecture

### **Task 4: Infrastructure Preparation** (Day 4-5)

#### **Enhanced Routing Infrastructure**:
```typescript
// Potential enhanced routing structure
interface ApplicationRoute {
  id: string;
  path: string;
  component: React.ComponentType;
  presentation: 'hud-embedded' | 'standalone' | 'modal';
  category: 'core' | 'analysis' | 'collaboration' | 'intelligence';
  dependencies: string[];
  permissions: string[];
}
```

#### **Routing Manager Enhancement**:
- **Route Registration**: Dynamic application registration system
- **Presentation Modes**: Support for HUD, standalone, and modal presentations
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain state across navigation
- **Deep Linking**: URL-based navigation to specific applications/views

#### **Navigation Components**:
- **Global Navigation**: Consistent navigation across presentation modes
- **Breadcrumbs**: Clear navigation context and history
- **Quick Switcher**: Rapid application/view switching (Cmd+K style)
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain workspace state during navigation
