# NetRunner Components Documentation

This directory contains documentation for all React components in the NetRunner application.

## Component Categories

### Layout Components (`layout/`)
Core structural components that define the main application layout and navigation.

### Widget Components (`widgets/`)
Specialized functional components that provide specific capabilities and tools.

### Shared Components (`shared/`)
Reusable UI components that maintain consistent styling and behavior across the application.

## Component Design Principles

### 1. **Single Responsibility**
Each component has a clearly defined purpose and scope of functionality.

### 2. **Composability**
Components are designed to work together in various combinations and configurations.

### 3. **Reusability**
Shared components can be used across different parts of the application.

### 4. **Type Safety**
All components use TypeScript with comprehensive prop and state typing.

### 5. **Performance**
Components implement React best practices for efficient rendering and memory usage.

## Documentation Standards

Each component documentation includes:

- **Purpose**: What the component does
- **Props**: Input parameters and their types
- **State**: Internal state management
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks used
- **Dependencies**: External dependencies
- **Usage Examples**: How to implement the component
- **Styling**: CSS/Material-UI styling approach
- **Performance**: Optimization considerations
- **Testing**: Test requirements and examples

## Integration Patterns

### State Management
- Components use custom hooks for state management
- Props are passed down for configuration
- Context is used for global application state

### Event Handling
- Components emit events for parent communication
- Custom hooks handle complex event logic
- Error boundaries protect against component failures

### Styling Strategy
- Material-UI components with custom theming
- Cyberpunk/military aesthetic consistency
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Dark theme optimization for OSINT operations
