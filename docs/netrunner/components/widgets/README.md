# Widget Components Documentation

Widget components provide specialized functionality and tools within the NetRunner application. Each widget serves a specific operational purpose and can be composed together to create comprehensive interfaces.

## Widget Categories

### AIAgentCommander (`AIAgentCommander/`)
Components for autonomous AI agent control and monitoring.

### PowerTools (`PowerTools/`)
Components for manual tool execution and management.

### OSINTNavigator (`OSINTNavigator/`)
Components for intelligence result browsing and navigation.

## Widget Design Principles

### 1. **Modularity**
Each widget is self-contained and can operate independently or be composed with other widgets.

### 2. **Configurability**
Widgets accept comprehensive configuration props to customize behavior and appearance.

### 3. **Interoperability**
Widgets communicate through well-defined interfaces and event systems.

### 4. **Performance**
Widgets are optimized for real-time operation and handle large datasets efficiently.

### 5. **Accessibility**
All widgets support keyboard navigation, screen readers, and accessibility standards.

## Integration Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture
Widgets communicate through events and callbacks rather than direct coupling:

```typescript
interface WidgetEventSystem {
  onAction: (action: WidgetAction) => void;
  onStateChange: (state: WidgetState) => void;
  onError: (error: WidgetError) => void;
  onDataRequest: (request: DataRequest) => Promise<DataResponse>;
}
```

### State Management
Widgets use a combination of local state and shared context:

- **Local State**: Widget-specific UI state and configuration
- **Shared Context**: Cross-widget communication and coordination
- **Service State**: Business logic and data processing

### Configuration System
Each widget accepts a configuration object that defines its behavior:

```typescript
interface WidgetConfiguration {
  id: string;
  type: WidgetType;
  position: WidgetPosition;
  size: WidgetSize;
  settings: WidgetSettings;
  permissions: WidgetPermissions;
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Lazy Loading
Widgets are loaded on-demand to improve initial application startup time.

### Virtual Scrolling
List-based widgets implement virtual scrolling for handling large datasets.

### Memoization
Expensive calculations are memoized to prevent unnecessary re-computation.

### Debouncing
User inputs are debounced to prevent excessive API calls and state updates.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
Each widget component is thoroughly unit tested for:
- Rendering with various props
- Event handling
- State management
- Error conditions

### Integration Testing
Widget interactions are tested to ensure proper communication and coordination.

### Performance Testing
Widgets are benchmarked for rendering performance and memory usage.

## Styling Guidelines

### Theme Consistency
All widgets use the global theme system for consistent styling across the application.

### Responsive Design
Widgets adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

### Accessibility
Widgets follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility compliance.

### Animation
Smooth animations and transitions enhance user experience without impacting performance.
