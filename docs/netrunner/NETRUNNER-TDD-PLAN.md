# NetRunner Test-Driven Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the NetRunner module in the Starcom application. The goal is to ensure all implemented functionality works correctly through systematic test coverage.

## Current Implementation

Based on our audit, the NetRunner module consists of the following key components:

1. **Core Components**
   - NetRunnerDashboard (Main UI interface)
   - PowerToolsPanel (OSINT tools interface)
   - IntelResultsViewer (Search results display)
   - MonitoringSystem (Alert and monitoring functionality)
   - MonitoringPanel & MonitoringDashboard (UI for monitoring)

2. **Tools and Adapters**
   - NetRunnerPowerTools (Collection of OSINT tools)
   - AdapterRegistry (Registry for tool adapters)
   - Tool adapters (ShodanAdapter, TheHarvesterAdapter, IntelAnalyzerAdapter, etc.)

3. **Integration Components**
   - WorkflowEngine (Automation workflow management)
   - BotRosterIntegration (Automated bots for intelligence gathering)
   - IntelAnalyzerIntegration (Analysis capability integration)

4. **Marketplace Components**
   - IntelligenceExchange (Marketplace for intelligence reports)
   - ListingManager (Management of marketplace listings)
   - TransactionService (Handling of marketplace transactions)
   - TokenizationService (Tokenization of intelligence reports)

5. **Custom Hooks**
   - useNetRunnerSearch (Search functionality)
   - useToolExecution (Tool execution management)

6. **Models and Types**
   - IntelReport (Intelligence report data model)
   - Various type definitions in netrunner.ts

## Test Coverage Implemented

We have implemented the following tests:

1. **MonitoringSystem Tests** (Complete)
   - Target management (creation, retrieval, updating)
   - Event processing (creation, handling)
   - Alert processing (creation, state transitions)
   - Manual collection process

2. **NetRunnerPowerTools Tests**
   - Tool collection validation
   - Tool property validation
   - Tool finding functions (by ID, category, intel type)

3. **AdapterRegistry Tests**
   - Adapter registration
   - Adapter retrieval
   - Multiple adapter handling

4. **WorkflowEngine Tests**
   - Workflow creation and management
   - Workflow execution
   - Step dependencies and ordering

5. **BotRosterIntegration Tests**
   - Bot creation and management
   - Bot capability matching
   - Bot operation assignment and execution

6. **IntelligenceExchange Tests**
   - Listing creation and management
   - Transaction processing
   - Listing search and filtering

7. **Hook Tests**
   - useNetRunnerSearch (search state, execution, filtering)
   - useToolExecution (tool execution state management)

8. **UI Component Tests**
   - IntelResultsViewer (display, interaction, filtering)

## Test Coverage Needed

To complete the TDD process, we need to implement the following additional tests:

1. **Component Tests**
   - NetRunnerDashboard.test.tsx
   - PowerToolsPanel.test.tsx
   - MonitoringPanel.test.tsx
   - MonitoringDashboard.test.tsx
   - CreateListingForm.test.tsx
   - UserMarketplaceDashboard.test.tsx
   - IntelAnalysisPanel.test.tsx
   - WorkflowControlPanel.test.tsx
   - EntityExtractor.test.tsx

2. **Adapter Tests**
   - ShodanAdapter.test.ts
   - TheHarvesterAdapter.test.ts
   - IntelAnalyzerAdapter.test.ts

3. **Integration Tests**
   - IntelAnalyzerIntegration.test.ts
   - End-to-end workflows combining multiple systems

4. **Model Tests**
   - IntelReport.test.ts (validation, serialization)

5. **Edge Case Tests**
   - Error handling in all components
   - Network failures in API calls
   - Invalid inputs to tools and adapters
   - Performance under load (large result sets)

## Testing Approach

For each component, the testing approach should follow these principles:

1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions and methods in isolation
2. **Component Testing**: Test React components render correctly and handle user interactions
3. **Integration Testing**: Test multiple components working together
4. **Mock Dependencies**: Use mocks for external services, APIs, and complex dependencies
5. **State Management**: Verify state updates correctly in response to events
6. **Error Handling**: Verify components handle error conditions gracefully

## Test Execution

To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To run specific test files:

```bash
npm test -- tests/NetRunner/MonitoringSystem.test.ts
```

## Continuous Integration

These tests should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure:

1. All tests pass before merging to main branches
2. Code coverage remains high (aim for 80%+ coverage)
3. Performance remains acceptable (test execution time)

## Next Steps

1. Implement the remaining test files listed above
2. Integrate test coverage reporting
3. Add integration tests for critical user flows
4. Ensure documentation stays up-to-date with implementation changes

By completing this testing strategy, we will ensure the NetRunner module is robust, reliable, and functions as expected across all its features.
