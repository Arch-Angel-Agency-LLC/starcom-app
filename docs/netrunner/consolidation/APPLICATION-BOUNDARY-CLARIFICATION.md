# Clarification on NetRunner and IntelAnalyzer Relationship

**Document Date**: July 10, 2025  
**Author**: GitHub Copilot  
**Status**: Draft  

## 1. Application Boundaries Clarification

This document clarifies the relationship between the NetRunner application and the IntelAnalyzer application, which are separate subsystems within the Starcom ecosystem. Previous documentation may have blurred these boundaries, and this document aims to establish clear separation and integration points.

## 2. Distinct Applications

### 2.1 NetRunner Application

NetRunner is a dedicated OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) collection platform focused on:
- Intelligence gathering from open sources
- Data collection and initial processing
- OSINT tool integration (Shodan, Maltego, etc.)
- Raw data acquisition and normalization
- Automated collection via bot roster
- Search capabilities across various intelligence sources

### 2.2 IntelAnalyzer Application

IntelAnalyzer is a separate application focused on intelligence analysis:
- Processing raw intelligence from various sources (including NetRunner)
- Entity extraction and relationship mapping
- Intelligence report generation
- Threat assessment and classification
- Pattern recognition and anomaly detection
- Intelligence packaging for the Intelligence Exchange Marketplace

## 3. Integration Points

The integration between these applications follows a defined flow:

1. **Data Collection**: NetRunner collects raw OSINT data
2. **Data Transfer**: NetRunner sends data to IntelAnalyzer via the IntelAnalyzerAdapter
3. **Analysis**: IntelAnalyzer processes the data into structured intelligence
4. **Report Generation**: IntelAnalyzer creates intelligence reports
5. **Marketplace Preparation**: IntelAnalyzer prepares reports for the marketplace

## 4. Boundary Enforcement

To maintain clear separation between these applications:

1. **Adapter-Based Integration**: NetRunner should only communicate with IntelAnalyzer through the IntelAnalyzerAdapter
2. **Defined Interfaces**: Clear interfaces should define the data passed between applications
3. **Separate Responsibilities**: NetRunner should focus on collection, IntelAnalyzer on analysis
4. **Independent Error Handling**: Each application should handle its own errors and provide clear feedback on failures

## 5. Code Organization

The code should be organized to maintain this separation:

```
src/applications/netrunner/          # NetRunner application
└── integration/
    └── adapters/
        └── IntelAnalyzerAdapter.ts  # Adapter for sending data to IntelAnalyzer

src/applications/intelanalyzer/      # IntelAnalyzer application
└── api/
    └── IntelAnalyzerAPI.ts          # API for receiving data from NetRunner
```

## 6. Consolidation Implications

This clarification has several implications for the consolidation effort:

1. **Scope Limitation**: The NetRunner consolidation should focus only on the NetRunner application and its adapters
2. **Adapter Enhancement**: The IntelAnalyzerAdapter should be enhanced to properly communicate with the separate IntelAnalyzer application
3. **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined interfaces should be established between the applications
4. **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling should be implemented at the integration points

## 7. Revised Integration Flow

This document serves as a foundation for revising the consolidation plan to maintain proper application boundaries.
