## Core Design Principles

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Components**: Pure UI presentation logic
- **Services**: Business logic and external integrations
- **Hooks**: State management and component lifecycle
- **Types**: Comprehensive type safety
- **Utils**: Reusable utility functions

### 2. **Military-Grade Modularity**
- Each component serves a specific tactical purpose
- Services are designed for independent operation
- Clear command and control hierarchies
- Fail-safe error handling and recovery

### 3. **Intelligence-First Design**
- All components support intelligence gathering
- Data flows through processing pipelines
- Prioritization and classification at every level
- AI-driven decision making integration

## Component Architecture

### Layout Components
- **Control Station**: Main command center container
- **Sidebars**: Specialized panels for different operations
- **Center View**: Primary scanning and analysis interface
- **Navigation Bars**: Command and status interfaces

### Widget Components
- **AI Agent Commander**: Autonomous operation control
- **Power Tools**: Manual tool execution
- **OSINT Navigator**: Intelligence browsing and management

### Shared Components
- **Cyber UI Elements**: Consistent cyberpunk styling
- **Status Indicators**: Real-time operational status
- **Priority Systems**: Threat and target prioritization

## Service Architecture

### Core Services
- **Scanner Services**: Website analysis and vulnerability detection
- **Crawler Services**: Deep reconnaissance and intelligence gathering

### Intelligence Services
- **Processing**: Raw data transformation and analysis
- **Assessment**: Threat evaluation and risk scoring
- **Recommendations**: Actionable intelligence generation

### Navigation Services
- **Route Management**: Target navigation and session tracking
- **Queue Management**: Priority-based target processing

### AI Services
- **Agent Control**: Autonomous operation management
- **Decision Matrix**: AI-driven tactical decisions
- **Auto Navigation**: Intelligent target traversal

## Data Flow Architecture
