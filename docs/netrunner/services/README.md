# Services Documentation

Services provide the core business logic, data processing, and external integrations for the NetRunner application. They are organized into logical categories based on functionality.

## Service Categories

### Core Services (`core/`)
Fundamental scanning and crawling capabilities that form the foundation of NetRunner operations.

### Intelligence Services (`intelligence/`)
Advanced data processing, analysis, and recommendation systems for actionable intelligence.

### Navigation Services (`navigation/`)
Target routing, session management, and queue processing for efficient operation workflows.

### AI Services (`ai/`)
Artificial intelligence and autonomous operation capabilities for enhanced automation.

## Service Architecture Principles

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
Each service has a specific responsibility and operates independently of other services.

### 2. **Dependency Injection**
Services use dependency injection patterns for easy testing and modular design.

### 3. **Error Handling**
Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation and recovery strategies.

### 4. **Performance**
Services are optimized for high-throughput operations and efficient resource usage.

### 5. **Extensibility**
Services provide plugin architectures and extension points for custom functionality.

## Service Communication

### Service-to-Service Communication
```typescript
interface ServiceCommunication {
  request<T>(service: string, method: string, params: any): Promise<T>;
  subscribe(service: string, event: string, callback: Function): void;
  publish(event: string, data: any): void;
  unsubscribe(service: string, event: string, callback: Function): void;
}
```

### Event System
Services communicate through a centralized event system for loose coupling and scalability.

### Data Flow
```
Input → Core Services → Intelligence Services → AI Services → Output
  ↑                                                               ↓
  └─────────────── Navigation Services ←─────────────────────────┘
```

## Service Interfaces

### Standard Service Interface
```typescript
interface NetRunnerService {
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
  start(): Promise<void>;
  stop(): Promise<void>;
  getStatus(): ServiceStatus;
  getMetrics(): ServiceMetrics;
  configure(config: ServiceConfiguration): void;
}
```

### Service Configuration
```typescript
interface ServiceConfiguration {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: string;
  dependencies: string[];
  settings: Record<string, any>;
  resources: ResourceLimits;
}
```

## Error Handling Strategy

### Error Types
- **Recoverable Errors**: Temporary failures that can be retried
- **Non-Recoverable Errors**: Permanent failures requiring user intervention
- **System Errors**: Critical system failures requiring service restart

### Error Recovery
```typescript
interface ErrorRecovery {
  retryAttempts: number;
  retryDelay: number;
  circuitBreaker: boolean;
  fallbackStrategy: FallbackStrategy;
}
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Collection
- Service execution time
- Memory usage
- Error rates
- Throughput metrics

### Performance Optimization
- Connection pooling
- Caching strategies
- Batch processing
- Resource management

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
Individual service methods and functions are unit tested for correctness and edge cases.

### Integration Tests
Service interactions and data flow are tested end-to-end.

### Performance Tests
Services are load tested to ensure they meet performance requirements.

### Chaos Testing
Services are tested under failure conditions to validate error handling and recovery.

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data is handled securely
- No persistent storage of credentials
- Secure communication protocols

### Access Control
- Service-level permissions
- API rate limiting
- Audit logging

## Documentation Standards

Each service documentation includes:

- **Purpose**: What the service does
- **API**: Public interface and methods
- **Configuration**: Available settings and options
- **Dependencies**: Required services and external systems
- **Performance**: Expected performance characteristics
- **Error Handling**: Error conditions and recovery strategies
- **Testing**: Test requirements and examples
- **Security**: Security considerations and requirements
