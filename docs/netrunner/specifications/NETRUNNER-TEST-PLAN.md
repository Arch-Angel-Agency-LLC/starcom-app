# NetRunner Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) plan for the NetRunner functionality in the Starcom application. The goal is to ensure all NetRunner components are thoroughly tested and functional.

## Test Structure
Tests will follow the same structure as the source code, with corresponding test files for each component.

### Core Components
1. **AdapterRegistry**
   - Test adapter registration/unregistration
   - Test adapter retrieval by ID
   - Test validation of adapter compliance with interfaces

2. **WorkflowEngine**
   - Test workflow creation and execution
   - Test workflow state management
   - Test error handling and recovery

3. **PowerTools**
   - Test each tool's functionality independently
   - Test tool integration with workflows
   - Test error handling and graceful degradation

4. **BotRosterIntegration**
   - Test bot registration and configuration
   - Test bot communication channels
   - Test permission management

### Marketplace Integration
1. **Tool Discovery**
   - Test tool discovery mechanisms
   - Test metadata retrieval
   - Test version compatibility

2. **Tool Installation**
   - Test installation processes
   - Test dependency resolution
   - Test rollback on failed installation

3. **Tool Execution**
   - Test sandboxed execution
   - Test resource allocation and limitations
   - Test result handling and error management

### Hooks and UI Components
1. **useToolExecution**
   - Test hook initialization
   - Test tool execution through the hook
   - Test state management and updates

2. **IntelResultsViewer**
   - Test rendering of different result types
   - Test interaction with results
   - Test accessibility and keyboard navigation

## Mock Strategies
- Create mock adapters that implement required interfaces
- Create mock tools with predictable behavior
- Create mock data sources for consistent testing

## Integration Testing
- Test complete workflows from user input to result display
- Test interaction between multiple tools in a single workflow
- Test system behavior under load

## Performance Testing
- Test tool execution time
- Test memory usage during complex operations
- Test UI responsiveness during tool execution

## Implementation Plan
1. Start with core component unit tests
2. Add integration tests between components
3. Add UI component tests
4. Add end-to-end workflow tests
5. Add performance benchmarks

## Test Maintenance
- Regular review of test coverage
- Update tests when interfaces change
- Automate test execution in CI/CD pipeline

## Quality Metrics
- Code coverage target: >85%
- Performance benchmarks:
  - Tool execution: <500ms for simple tools
  - UI updates: <100ms for state changes
  - Memory usage: <50MB per active workflow
