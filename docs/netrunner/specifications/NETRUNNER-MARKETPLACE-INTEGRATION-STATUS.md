# NetRunner Marketplace Integration Status Update

**Date:** July 8, 2025  
**Status:** Implementation In Progress

## Overview

This document provides an update on the implementation status of the Intelligence Exchange Marketplace integration in the NetRunner module. The marketplace enables users to package, list, purchase, and trade intelligence reports as tokenized digital assets.

## Components Implemented

1. **Data Models and Interfaces**
   - IntelListingEntry structure for marketplace listings
   - IntelTransaction structure for transaction handling
   - TokenizedIntel interface for blockchain assets

2. **Service Layer**
   - ListingManager for creating and managing listings
   - TokenizationService for blockchain tokenization
   - TransactionService for handling marketplace transactions

3. **UI Components**
   - CreateListingForm for creating new marketplace listings
   - UserMarketplaceDashboard for managing user's marketplace activity

## Integration Points

The marketplace integration connects several systems:

1. **NetRunner Intelligence Reports** → **Marketplace Listings**
   - Reports can be converted to marketplace listings
   - Listings can be tokenized as blockchain assets

2. **Marketplace Listings** → **Blockchain**
   - Intel reports can be tokenized on multiple blockchains
   - Ownership and transfer handled via blockchain transactions

3. **User Wallets** → **Marketplace Transactions**
   - Purchasing and selling intel requires wallet integration
   - Transaction history tracked and displayed

## Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Data Models | ✅ Complete | All required interfaces defined |
| Listing Management | ✅ Complete | CreateListing, UpdateListing APIs implemented |

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Wallet Services**
   - Connect to Solana and Ethereum wallets
   - Implement wallet selection and connection UI

2. **Backend Storage**
   - Implement real database storage for listings
   - Set up transaction history persistence

3. **Smart Contract Development**
   - Develop and deploy marketplace smart contracts
   - Implement escrow functionality for secure transactions

4. **Testing**
   - Develop comprehensive test suite for marketplace functions
   - Perform security audits on smart contracts

## Conclusion

The Intelligence Exchange Marketplace integration has made significant progress with the implementation of core functionality and user interfaces. The next phase will focus on connecting to real blockchain services and implementing the backend storage systems required for production use.

The development team should now focus on wallet integration and smart contract development to enable real transactions on the marketplace.
