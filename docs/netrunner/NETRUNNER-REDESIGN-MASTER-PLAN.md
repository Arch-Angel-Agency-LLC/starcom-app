# NetRunner Redesign Master Plan

**Date Created:** July 7, 2025  
**Last Updated:** July 7, 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase

## Overview

This document serves as the master plan for tracking the redesign and implementation of the new NetRunner interface and functionality. NetRunner is being enhanced as an advanced hyper tool within the Starcom dApp, focused on producing, analyzing, and trading "Intel" (blockchain-based, tradable commodity).

## Core Integration Points

- **BotRoster** - Bot creation and registry
- **IntelAnalyzer** - Packaging Intel into reports
- **Intelligence Exchange Marketplace** - Trading platform for Intel

## Key Objectives

1. Redesign the NetRunner UI to support new modes of operation
2. Integrate OSINT power tools for enhanced intelligence gathering
3. Create seamless integration with BotRoster for automated Intel collection
4. Implement advanced Intel analysis capabilities
5. Develop a marketplace interface for Intel trading
6. Build comprehensive monitoring capabilities
7. Ensure all components work together as a cohesive system

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Integration complexity | High | Medium | Create detailed integration specs, implement incrementally |
| Performance issues with multiple tools | Medium | High | Implement lazy loading, optimize tool execution |
| User adoption challenges | High | Low | Create intuitive UI, provide documentation and tutorials |
| Intel quality concerns | High | Medium | Implement validation and verification processes |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Conduct security audits, implement secure coding practices |

## Next Steps

1. Complete the architecture overview document
2. Finalize technical specifications
3. Create UI/UX mockups for all dashboard modes
4. Begin implementation of core dashboard framework

## Regular Updates

This document will be updated weekly to reflect the current status of the project.
