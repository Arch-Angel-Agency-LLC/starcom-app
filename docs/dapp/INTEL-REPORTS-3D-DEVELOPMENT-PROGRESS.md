## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions Made:
- **Single Source of Truth**: `IntelReport3DData` as the canonical interface
- **Context-Aware Design**: All types include HUD context from the start
- **Migration-First**: Backward compatibility as a first-class concern
- **Performance-Oriented**: Optimized for viewport culling and large datasets
- **Modular Exports**: Clean import/export structure for tree-shaking

### Key Technical Decisions:
- Used `Map<string, IntelReport3DData>` for O(1) lookups in services
- Implemented viewport-based culling for performance optimization
- Created universal adapter pattern for handling all legacy formats
- Designed context state to integrate seamlessly with HUD architecture
