## Deployment Strategies

### Solo Operations
- Single specialist handles entire intelligence requirement
- Best for focused, domain-specific investigations
- Faster deployment, simpler coordination

### Squadron Operations  
- Multiple specialists work in parallel or sequence
- Comprehensive intelligence gathering across domains
- AI Agent coordinates specialists for optimal coverage

### Swarm Operations
- Large number of specialists for massive intelligence gathering
- Used for comprehensive target analysis
- Requires sophisticated coordination and deduplication

This specialization framework ensures each bot type has a clear mission profile while maintaining flexibility for evolution and hybrid capabilities as the NetRunner ecosystem grows.
