# NetRunner Bot Roster Ecosystem

## Overview

The NetRunner Bot Roster represents a sophisticated intelligence gathering ecosystem where specialized bots function as autonomous OSINT operatives. This documentation outlines the design philosophy, implementation strategy, and operational framework for creating a diverse bot ecosystem that can be commanded by AI Agents.

## Documentation Structure

- **[Bot Architecture](./bot-architecture.md)** - Core bot design principles and technical framework
- **[Bot Creation UX](./bot-creation-ux.md)** - User experience for creating and configuring specialized bots
- **[Bot Specializations](./bot-specializations.md)** - Detailed specifications for different bot types
- **[AI Agent Integration](./ai-agent-integration.md)** - How AI Agents command and coordinate bot squadrons
- **[Intelligence Pipeline](./intelligence-pipeline.md)** - Data flow from bots to Intel marketplace
- **[Operational Framework](./operational-framework.md)** - Bot deployment, management, and performance tracking
- **[Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md)** - Development phases and technical milestones

## Core Philosophy

### Bots as Intelligence Specialists
NetRunner bots are not generic automation tools - they are **specialized intelligence operatives** with:
- **Mission-specific capabilities** for different OSINT domains
- **Tool proficiency** for operating specific PowerTools
- **Intelligence output** that feeds the broader Intel ecosystem
- **Operational characteristics** that define their stealth, speed, and depth

### AI Agent Command Structure
Future AI Agents will orchestrate bot squadrons like intelligence directors:
- **Strategic planning** - AI determines intelligence objectives
- **Tactical deployment** - AI selects and coordinates appropriate bot specialists
- **Intelligence synthesis** - AI correlates bot outputs into actionable intel

### Intelligence Production Pipeline
```
Target → Bot Squadron → PowerTools → RawData → Intel Processing → Marketplace
```

## Key Design Principles

1. **Capability-First Design** - Bots are defined by what intelligence they gather
2. **Specialization Over Generalization** - Each bot excels in specific OSINT domains
3. **Tool Proficiency Matching** - Bots are matched to compatible PowerTools
4. **Intelligence Quality Focus** - Bot performance measured by intel value, not speed
5. **Hierarchical Command** - AI Agents → Bot Squadrons → Individual Tools

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Bot Architecture](./bot-architecture.md) document to understand the technical foundation, then proceed to [Bot Specializations](./bot-specializations.md) for specific bot type implementations.
