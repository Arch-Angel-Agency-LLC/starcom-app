## 🔄 **STEP 5: Advanced Collaboration Workflows**

### **Investigation Coordination**

**Scenario**: Multiple analysts investigating the same threat

```typescript
// Example: Coordinated APT29 investigation
Investigation: "APT29 Campaign Q1 2025"
├── Team Lead: Strategic oversight
├── Malware Analyst: Sample analysis  
├── Network Analyst: Traffic analysis
├── Attribution Analyst: Actor profiling
└── Intel Analyst: Threat landscape
```

**Workflow**:
1. **Team Lead** creates investigation
2. **Assigns tasks** to specialists
3. **Each analyst** uploads findings
4. **Real-time sync** across all team members
5. **Collaborative report** generated automatically

### **Multi-Team Collaboration**

**Scenario**: Government agency coordinating with private sector

```
Primary Team: "FBI Cyber Division"
├── Shares findings with: "CrowdStrike Intelligence"  
├── Coordinates with: "Microsoft Security"
└── Reports to: "CISA"
```

**Setup**:
1. **Create partnerships** between teams
2. **Set sharing permissions** per investigation
3. **Auto-sync** relevant intelligence
4. **Maintain** separate classification levels

## 🛠️ **STEP 7: Technical Implementation**

### **Enable Public Infrastructure in Your dApp**

**Update your configuration**:

```typescript
// src/config/deploymentConfig.ts
export const DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG = {
  mode: 'hybrid', // 'serverless' | 'hybrid' | 'enterprise'
  
  // Public infrastructure
  enablePublicRelays: true,
  enablePublicIPFS: true,
  
  // Fallback settings
  fallbackToPublic: true,
  publicInfrastructureTimeout: 10000
};
```

**Add public relay connections**:

```typescript
// Automatic public relay connection
const publicRelays = [
  'wss://relay.damus.io',
  'wss://nos.lol',
  'wss://relay.snort.social'
];

// Connect to public IPFS gateways
const ipfsGateways = [
  'https://ipfs.io/ipfs/',
  'https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/',
  'https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/'
];
```

### **Team Discovery Implementation**

```typescript
// Team discovery via Nostr
const announceTeam = async (team: CyberTeam) => {
  const event = {
    kind: 30000, // Custom team announcement
    content: JSON.stringify({
      teamId: team.id,
      name: team.name,
      type: team.type,
      isPublic: team.allowExternalCollaboration,
      inviteRequired: team.requireApprovalForMembers
    }),
    tags: [
      ['d', team.id],
      ['team-type', team.type],
      ['recruitment', 'open']
    ]
  };
  
  await nostrService.publishEvent(event);
};
```
