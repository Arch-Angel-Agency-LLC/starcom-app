# CI/CD Playwright Integration Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-02

## 1. Objective

To fully automate the execution of the Playwright E2E test suite within the project's Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This ensures that every proposed change to the codebase is automatically validated against our most critical user-facing workflows, preventing regressions from reaching production.

## 2. Automation Platform

- **Platform:** GitHub Actions

## 3. Workflow Configuration

A new workflow file will be created at `.github/workflows/playwright-e2e-tests.yml`.

### 3.1. Trigger

The workflow will be triggered on two events:

1.  **`push`:** On every push to the `main` branch.
2.  **`pull_request`:** On every pull request targeting the `main` branch.

### 3.2. Job Steps

The workflow will consist of a single job, `run-e2e-tests`, that performs the following steps:

1.  **Checkout Code:**
    - `uses: actions/checkout@v4`
    - Clones the repository code into the runner environment.

2.  **Set up Node.js:**
    - `uses: actions/setup-node@v4`
    - Installs the specified version of Node.js (e.g., 20.x).

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    - `run: npm ci`
    - Installs the exact project dependencies from `package-lock.json` for a reproducible build.

4.  **Install Playwright Browsers:**
    - `run: npx playwright install --with-deps`
    - Downloads the browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) required by Playwright, including OS-level dependencies.

5.  **Run Playwright Tests:**
    - `run: npx playwright test`
    - Executes the entire Playwright test suite. The `playwright.config.ts` is already configured to start the web server, so no separate build or serve step is needed here.

6.  **Upload Test Report:**
    - `uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4`
    - `if: always()`
    - This step runs even if the tests fail. It uploads the generated Playwright HTML report as a build artifact.
    - This is critical for debugging, as it allows developers to download and view the full, interactive report with traces, screenshots, and videos of the failed tests.

## 4. Branch Protection

To enforce this new quality gate, a branch protection rule will be applied to the `main` branch requiring the `run-e2e-tests` job to pass before a pull request can be merged.
