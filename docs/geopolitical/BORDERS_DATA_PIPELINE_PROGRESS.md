## 1. Overview
This document operationalizes the prioritized quick-win data engineering and runtime improvements for geopolitical borders. It complements `GEOPOITICAL_EXPANSION_PLAN.md` by focusing specifically on border & maritime datasets, normalization, integrity, and performance foundations required for advanced analytics and future submodes.

---
## 2. Objectives & Scope
High-impact, low-to-medium effort upgrades that:
- Standardize classification semantics (land + maritime) across LODs & perspectives.
- Shrink payload size via TopoJSON + shared topology.
- Fill inactive UI toggles (maritime EEZ) with real data.
- Provide reproducible, verifiable dataset provenance & integrity.
- Accelerate interaction (hover/pick) with spatial indexing.
- Establish stable arc/segment IDs and metrics to unlock analytics & deltas.

Out of Scope (for this phase): Label rendering, alliance overlays, dynamic dispute enrichment beyond basic classification tags.

## 3. Workstreams (WS)
| ID | Title | Goal | Deliverables | Exit Criteria |
|----|-------|------|-------------|---------------|
| WS1 | Classification Normalization & Recognition Matrix | Canonical enum + perspective matrix | `normalization.ts`, `normalized_borders_LOD*.json`, tests, stats report | <1% UNKNOWN; matrix JSON accessible at runtime |

| WS3 | Maritime EEZ Integration | Activate maritime toggle & overlaps | `eez_raw/`, `eez_topology.topo.json`, merged classification | EEZ renders; overlaps flagged & toggleable |
| WS4 | Provenance & Metadata Manifest | Reproducibility & integrity check | `manifest.json`, `verifyIntegrity.ts`, UI status | All datasets hash-verified; mismatch path tested |
| WS5 | Spatial Index for Interaction | Faster hover/pick | Precomputed R-tree / Flatbush data blob, loader integration | ‚â•60% hover perf improvement dense region |
| WS6 | Stable IDs & Segment Metrics | Deterministic analytics substrate | `metrics-build.mjs`, `border_metrics.json`, runtime attachment | 100% arcs stableID; length error <1% |

## 9. Detailed Task Logs
### Iteration A (WS1)
- Tasks: Build mapping table; implement parser; generate matrix; produce stats; unit tests; integrate loader fallback.
- Commits: (Scaffold added normalization regex + recognition matrix cache)
- Notes: Initial matrix built at runtime; next: persist stats & expand mapping table.
- Added: normalization/normalization.ts with canonical enum & stats generation.
- Added: generate-normalized-borders.ts build script.
- Run: geo:normalize produced normalized artifacts & summary (365 features, 0% unknown).
- Added: loader fallback to consume normalized artifacts when present.
- Risks: Coverage of rare FEATURECLA variants (monitor future datasets).

### Iteration B (WS2)
- Tasks: Build topology builder; quantization tuning; arc hashing; loader refactor; size benchmark.
- Progress: Initial topology built (quantization=1e5, arcs=947).
- Added: arcHashes + arcIds (sha1) stored in topology.
- Added: runtime topology loader consumption (preferred source).
- Benchmark: Raw all LODs 1,163,821 B (gzip 182,785 B); Topology 595,096 B (gzip 90,773 B) ‚Üí Reduction vs raw (bytes 48.9%, gzip 50.4%).
- Reuse Metric: unique arcs 947; total arc refs 1,095; avg refs/arc 1.156 (needs improvement, suggests many single-use arcs).
- Quantization Error: mean rel 0.123%, max rel 2.29% (outliers to inspect; within mean target).
- Next: Optional arc merging to raise reuse; finalize WS2 report & close WS2.

### Iteration C (WS3)
- Tasks: Acquire EEZ dataset; simplify; integrate classification; overlap detection.
- Progress: Ingestion & processing scripts; turf installed; topology builder; service maritime loader & material classification; fetch automation script added (geo:eez:fetch).

### Iteration D (WS4)
- Tasks: Manifest generation script; runtime verifier; UI status states; tamper test.
- Progress: Manifest script + initial artifact hashes.

### Iteration E (WS5)
- Tasks: Precompute bounding boxes; build Flatbush; adapt hover; benchmark.

### Iteration F (WS6)
- Tasks: Arc metrics (length, midpoint); ID assignment; metrics export; attach userData; regression tests.

## 10. Risk & Mitigation
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Over-aggressive quantization distorts borders | Medium | Medium | Hausdorff error guard & visual diff snapshot |
| EEZ licensing constraints | Low | High | Verify dataset license prior to inclusion; document in manifest |
| Spatial index memory overhead | Low | Medium | Use typed arrays; measure heap delta |
| Hash computation blocking UI | Low | Low | Offload to idle / requestIdleCallback |
| Multiple enum revisions causing churn | Medium | Low | Version enum; backward compatibility layer |

---
## 11. Integrity Verification Procedure (Planned)
1. Load manifest.json.  
2. For each dataset: fetch, stream hash (SHA-256), compare to manifest.  
3. Record status map {id: OK|MISMATCH|MISSING}.  
4. Expose UI indicator (green/amber/red) + re-verify button.  
5. If mismatch: log diagnostic (expected vs actual hash) and block advanced analytics (feature flag).  

---
## 12. Stable ID Strategy (Preview)
ArcID = `a_` + first 8 hex of SHA1(quantizedCoordSequence).  
Feature border stable ID = deterministic join of sorted arcIDs hashed again (prefix `f_`).  
Metrics: length (Vincenty or haversine segmented), number of arcs, classification, optional claimant codes (if available later).

## 13. Acceptance Gates per Workstream
| WS | Gate |
|----|------|
| 1 | Report JSON: countsPerClass, unknownPct, perspectivesMatrix size > 0 |
| 2 | Size report: original vs topo vs % reduction; arc reuse stats |
| 3 | Maritime toggle shows/hides EEZ lines within 150ms; overlap count > 0 where expected |
| 4 | UI integrity badge cycles through (pending ‚Üí ok) automatically; tamper test triggers mismatch |
| 5 | Benchmark script logs pre vs post frame cost delta meeting target |
| 6 | metrics file present, random sample of 5 arcIDs stable across 2 rebuilds |
