# OSINT Development Update

## Service Layer Implementation

The OSINT Cyber Investigation Suite now has a full service layer implementation that connects the UI components to data sources. The implementation follows the design outlined in the OSINT-DATA-INTEGRATION-PLAN and includes the following key features:

### 1. Core Service Architecture

- **API Client**: Base client for all API operations with authentication support
- **Endpoint Definitions**: Centralized endpoint management
- **Mock Data Generation**: Development-friendly mock data

### 2. Implemented Services

- **Search Service**: Universal search across multiple data sources
- **Graph Service**: Entity relationship visualization
- **Timeline Service**: Chronological event analysis
- **Investigation Service**: Investigation management
- **Map Service**: Geospatial intelligence
- **Blockchain Service**: Cryptocurrency and blockchain analysis
- **Dark Web Service**: Dark web monitoring and alerts
- **OPSEC Service**: Operational security and protection

### 3. React Hooks

Custom hooks have been created to make using these services easy in React components:

- **useOSINTSearch**: Search functionality and results management
- **useEntityGraph**: Graph data and node operations
- **useTimelineAnalysis**: Timeline data and event correlation
- **useMapData**: Geospatial data visualization and interaction
- **useBlockchainAnalysis**: Blockchain intelligence and analytics
- **useDarkWebMonitoring**: Dark web monitoring and alerts
- **useOPSECSecurity**: Operational security and identity protection

### 4. UI Integration

The following components have been updated to use the new services:

- **SearchPanel**: Now uses useOSINTSearch for real search functionality
- **ResultsPanel**: Displays real search results from the search service
- **GraphPanel**: Integrated with useEntityGraph for network visualization
- **TimelinePanel**: Connected to useTimelineAnalysis for chronological event analysis
- **MapPanel**: Using useMapData for geospatial intelligence visualization
- **BlockchainPanel**: Using useBlockchainAnalysis for cryptocurrency and blockchain analysis
- **DarkWebPanel**: Connected to useDarkWebMonitoring for dark web intelligence
- **OPSECPanel**: Using useOPSECSecurity for operational security protection

## Next Steps

### 1. Panel Interactions

- Implement inter-panel communication
- Connect data between search, graph, and timeline
- Implement entity selection propagation

### 2. Enhanced Features

- Complete panel layout drag-and-drop functionality
- Add layout presets
- Implement advanced filtering

### 4. Backend Integration

- When ready, connect to real backend API
- Implement proper authentication flow
- Add real data source connections

## Technical Details

The service architecture uses TypeScript interfaces for type safety and follows a layered approach:

1. **UI Components**: React components that display data
2. **Custom Hooks**: React hooks that provide component-specific functionality
3. **Services**: Business logic and data access
4. **API Layer**: Communication with external systems

All services are implemented as singleton instances for consistent state management across the application.
