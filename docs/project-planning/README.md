- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation during connectivity issues

## Using These Documents

- **For Developers**: Start with the Development Summary to understand the current state, then refer to specific component documentation as needed
- **For Project Managers**: Development Roadmap and Status documents provide milestone tracking and progress updates
- **For QA**: Testing requirements are documented in each component's technical specification
- **For New Team Members**: Integration guides provide context on how components fit into the larger application

## Updating Documentation

As development progresses, please update these documents to reflect the current state of the project. Particularly:

1. Mark completed tasks in the roadmap documents
2. Update implementation status as components are developed
3. Refine technical specifications as requirements evolve
4. Document any major architectural changes
