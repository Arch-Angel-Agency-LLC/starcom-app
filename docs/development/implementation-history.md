## Key Architectural Decisions

### Component Architecture
**Decision**: Modular component design with clear separation of concerns  
**Rationale**: Enables independent development, testing, and maintenance  
**Impact**: Improved code organization and team productivity

### Feature Flag System
**Decision**: Comprehensive feature flag management  
**Rationale**: Safe gradual rollouts and easy feature toggling  
**Impact**: Reduced deployment risk and better user experience control

### Context-Based State Management
**Decision**: React Context for global state instead of Redux  
**Rationale**: Simpler setup for application size and complexity  
**Impact**: Faster development with sufficient state management capabilities

### TypeScript Throughout
**Decision**: Strict TypeScript configuration  
**Rationale**: Better development experience and fewer runtime errors  
**Impact**: Higher code quality and improved developer productivity

### Safety-First Testing
**Decision**: Comprehensive safety monitoring in AI testing  
**Rationale**: Prevent system damage from autonomous testing  
**Impact**: Reliable testing infrastructure that doesn't crash systems

## Technical Debt & Lessons Learned

### Documentation Management
**Issue**: Documentation and artifacts became scattered and redundant  
**Solution**: Comprehensive reorganization into structured documentation  
**Lesson**: Establish documentation guidelines early and maintain them

### Feature Scope Management
**Issue**: Feature creep in testing infrastructure  
**Solution**: Clear separation between production and diagnostic features  
**Lesson**: Define clear boundaries between core features and development tools

### Performance Monitoring
**Issue**: Need for better real-time performance tracking  
**Solution**: Integrated monitoring throughout the application  
**Lesson**: Build monitoring into the architecture from the beginning

### User Experience Focus
**Issue**: Developer features affecting executive user experience  
**Solution**: UI Testing Diagnostics Mode toggle system  
**Lesson**: Always consider the end-user perspective in feature development
