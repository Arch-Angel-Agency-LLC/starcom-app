# Starcom App Restructuring - July 2025

## Overview

The Starcom App has been successfully restructured to improve development workflow, reduce complexity, and ensure all code is properly organized in a single, coherent structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed AI Security RelayNode Leftovers

- Completely removed the `ai-security-relaynode` directory which was taking up space
- Removed any references to RelayNode from the main codebase
- The RelayNode component has been moved to its own dedicated repository

### 2. Migrated DApp Directory to Main Directory

- All application code from the `dapp` directory has been moved to the main directory
- Frontend React/TypeScript code is now in the `src` directory
- Configuration files are now in the root directory (vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Scripts have been moved to the `scripts` directory

### 3. Updated Documentation

- README.md has been updated to reflect the new structure
- Created this RESTRUCTURE-SUMMARY.md document
- All important documentation has been preserved in the `docs` directory

### 4. Added VS Code Tasks

Added the following VS Code tasks to make development easier:
- **Build and Run Starcom App**: Builds the app and starts the development server
- **Build Starcom App**: Only builds the app
- **Run Dev Server**: Starts the development server

## Project Structure

The Starcom App now has a streamlined structure:

```
starcom-app/
├── asset development/   # Assets in development
├── backup_logs/         # Backup logs
├── docs/                # Documentation
├── public/              # Static assets for the web app
├── scripts/             # Utility scripts
├── src/                 # Source code
│   ├── api/             # API clients
│   ├── components/      # React components
│   ├── context/         # React context providers
│   ├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
│   ├── pages/           # Page components
│   ├── services/        # Service layer
│   └── utils/           # Utility functions
├── .vscode/             # VS Code configuration
├── package.json         # NPM package definition
├── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration
└── vite.config.ts       # Vite configuration
```

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Functionality**: Run the application and verify that all features work as expected
2. **Update Documentation**: Continue to update documentation as needed
3. **Remove Redundant Files**: Identify and remove any remaining redundant files
4. **Optimize Build Process**: Further optimize the build process for faster development

## How to Run the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

Alternatively, use the VS Code tasks:
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to run the default "Build and Run Starcom App" task
- Select from other tasks using the Task menu
