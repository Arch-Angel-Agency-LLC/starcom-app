# IntelDataCore Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the IntelDataCore system, providing a structured approach to development, integration, and deployment. The roadmap is designed to deliver incremental value while managing risk and ensuring quality throughout the development lifecycle.

## Implementation Principles

1. **Incremental Development**: Build core functionality first, then expand
2. **Module Integration Priority**: Focus on highest-value module integrations first
3. **Continuous Testing**: Test-driven development throughout implementation
4. **Regular Deliverables**: Produce working software at the end of each phase
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Address high-risk components early
6. **Technical Debt Avoidance**: Maintain quality standards from the start
7. **Documentation First**: Document architecture and APIs before implementation
