Â (victim of [[John Costello]]

Based on the information provided in the John Costello article, there are several elements that could potentially be considered fishy or suspicious with a focus on investigating corruption. Here are a few aspects that stand out: 

**1) Plea Deal and Lack of Jail Time:** John Costello pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter but avoided jail time due to a plea deal. This outcome could raise suspicions about possible connections or influence that allowed him to receive a relatively lenient sentence, which could be an intriguing plot point for the investigation. 

**2) Settlement Amount:** The substantial settlement amount of $5.5 million, to be paid on behalf of Costello and his business, raises questions about potential hidden assets or undisclosed sources of wealth. This could lead the investigator to dig deeper into Costello's financial affairs and uncover potential corruption or illicit activities. 

**3) Disputed Claims and Expert Opinion:** The conflicting accounts regarding John Costello's alcohol consumption and the dispute over Bartolone Miguel's pain and suffering could suggest attempts to manipulate or deceive the legal proceedings. The investigation could explore the motives behind these disputes, including the potential involvement of influential individuals trying to protect Costello. 

**4) Connections and Influence:** The article mentions Costello's successful contracting business, which could imply a network of connections and potential ties to powerful individuals or organizations. Investigating these connections could reveal a web of corruption, with Costello being just one piece of a larger puzzle. 

**5) Character Motivations:** Understanding the motivations of the various individuals involved, including the judge, the winemaker serving as the executor of Miguel's estate, and others, could add depth to the case timeline. Exploring their potential biases, personal interests, or hidden agendas could provide opportunities for the us to uncover additional layers of corruption.
