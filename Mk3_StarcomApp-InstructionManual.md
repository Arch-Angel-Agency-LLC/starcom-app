- **IPFS** (latest version)
- **Nostr** (latest version)

#### Initial Setup

1. **Install Node.js and npm:**

   Install Node.js and npm if they are not already installed on your system. You can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a New Vite Project:**

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest starcom-super-app --template react-ts
   cd starcom-super-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install axios ipfs-http-client nostr-tools
   ```

4. **Set Up TypeScript Configuration:**

   Ensure your `tsconfig.json` is set up correctly:

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "target": "ESNext",
       "module": "ESNext",
       "jsx": "react-jsx",
       "strict": true,
       "moduleResolution": "node",
       "resolveJsonModule": true,
       "isolatedModules": true,
       "esModuleInterop": true,
       "skipLibCheck": true
     },
     "include": ["src"]
   }
   ```

5. **Install and Configure Vite:**

   ```bash
   npm install vite --save-dev
   ```

   Add the following to `vite.config.ts`:

   ```typescript
   import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
   import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [react()],
     server: {
       open: true
     }
   });
   ```

6. **Configure IPFS:**

   Initialize and configure IPFS:

   ```bash
   ipfs init
   ipfs config Addresses.API /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001
   ipfs config Addresses.Gateway /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8080
   ```

7. **Set Up Nostr:**

   Set up a Nostr relay:

   ```bash
   nostr relay --port 8081
   ```

### Page 3: Advanced Features and Enhancements

#### Enhancing User Experience

1. **Interactive Dashboards:**
   - Use libraries like D3.js or Chart.js for interactive data visualization.

   ```typescript
   // src/components/Dashboard.tsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { Line } from 'react-chartjs-2';

   const Dashboard: React.FC = () => {
     const data = {
       labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July'],
       datasets: [
         {
           label: 'Threats Detected',
           data: [65, 59, 80, 81, 56, 55, 40],
           fill: false,
           backgroundColor: 'rgba(75,192,192,0.2)',
           borderColor: 'rgba(75,192,192,1)',
         },
       ],
     };

     return <Line data={data} />;
   };

   export default Dashboard;
   ```

2. **Tooltips and Info Boxes:**
   - Enhance user interaction with tooltips and detailed information pop-ups.

   ```typescript
   // src/components/InfoBox.tsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { Box, Tooltip } from '@chakra-ui/react';

   const InfoBox: React.FC<{ label: string; content: string }> = ({ label, content }) => {
     return (
       <Tooltip label={label}>
         <Box className="info-box">{content}</Box>
       </Tooltip>
     );
   };

   export default InfoBox;
   ```

#### Improving Performance

1. **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading:**
   - Optimize performance by splitting code and lazy loading components.

   ```typescript
   // src/App.tsx
   import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';
   import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

   const BotRoster = lazy(() => import('./components/BotRoster'));
   const IntelTimeline = lazy(() => import('./components/IntelTimelineScrubber'));

   const App: React.FC = () => {
     return (
       <Router>
         <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
           <Switch>
             <Route path="/bot-roster" component={BotRoster} />
             <Route path="/intel-timeline" component={IntelTimeline} />
           </Switch>
         </Suspense>
       </Router>
     );
   };

   export default App;
   ```

2. **Caching and Optimizations:**
   - Implement caching strategies to reduce load times and improve user experience.

   ```typescript
   // src/services/cache.ts
   const cache = new Map<string, any>();

   export const setCache = (key: string, value: any) => {
     cache.set(key, value);
   };

   export const getCache = (key: string) => {
     return cache.get(key);
   };
   ```

### Bonus Page 1: Security and Best Practices

#### Ensuring Data Security

1. **HTTPS and SSL:**
   - Ensure all communications are encrypted using HTTPS and SSL.

   ```bash
   # Generate SSL certificate using OpenSSL
   openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout selfsigned.key -out selfsigned.crt
   ```

2. **Regular Updates:**
   - Keep all dependencies and libraries up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.

   ```bash
   # Update npm packages
   npm update
   ```

3. **Secure Configurations:**
   - Regularly review and update configurations for security.

   ```typescript
   // src/config.ts
   export const config = {
     ipfs: {
       apiUrl: 'https://ipfs.infura.io:5001',
     },
     nostr: {
       relayUrl: 'wss://relay.example.com',
     },
   };
   ```

#### Best Practices for Decentralized Development

1. **Follow Web3 Standards:**
   - Ensure compliance with web3 standards for decentralized applications.

2. **Use Open-Source Libraries:**
   - Leverage open-source libraries and contribute back to the community.

3. **Automate Testing:**
   - Implement automated testing to catch issues early.

   ```bash
   # Example Jest configuration for automated testing
   jest --watch
   ```

---

### Bonus Page 2: Continuous Integration and Deployment

#### Implementing CI/CD

1. **Continuous Integration:**
   - Use CI tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated testing and builds.

   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/ci.yml
   name: CI

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Set up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v2
           with:
             node-version: '14'
         - run: npm install
         - run: npm run build
         - run: npm test
   ```

2. **Continuous Deployment:**
   - Automate deployment processes using tools like Docker and Kubernetes.

   ```dockerfile
   # Dockerfile
   FROM node:14

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm install

   COPY . .

   EXPOSE 3000
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```

   ```yaml
   # Kubernetes deployment configuration
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: starcom-super-app
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: starcom-super-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: starcom-super-app
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: starcom-super-app
           image: starcom-super-app:latest
           ports:
           - containerPort: 3000
   ```

#### Monitoring and Logging

1. **Prometheus and Grafana:**
   - Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring performance and health.

   ```yaml
   # prometheus.yml
   global:
     scrape_interval: 15s

   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'StarcomSuperApp'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['localhost:3000']
   ```

2. **Winston for Logging:**
   - Implement advanced logging with Winston.

   ```typescript
   // src/services/logger.ts
   import winston from 'winston';

   const logger = winston.createLogger({
     level: 'info',
     format: winston.format.combine(
       winston.format.timestamp(),
