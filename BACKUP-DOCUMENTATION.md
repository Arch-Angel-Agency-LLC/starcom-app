This backup was created after completing the consolidation of chat components in the Starcom app project. The backup contains the full codebase with all consolidated components, fixed build errors, and updated documentation.

## Backup Contents
1. All source code files
2. Documentation (including updated CHAT-CONSOLIDATION-REPORT.md)

1. Extract the zip file to a desired location
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

## Network Drive Information
For future backups, ensure the network drive is mounted:
- **Drive**: LS220D8F9 
- **Volume**: dataDrive_4TB
- **Mount Path**: /Volumes/dataDrive_4TB/LS220D8F9

## Backup Scripts
Two scripts were created to manage backups:
1. `backup_script.sh` - Creates the backup
2. `verify_backup.sh` - Verifies the backup integrity

These scripts are stored in the project root directory for future use.

## Next Steps
1. When network drive is available, manually copy the backup file to:
   `/Volumes/dataDrive_4TB/LS220D8F9/starcom-app_backup_20250704_023337.zip`
2. Schedule regular backups using the provided scripts
3. Create documentation about the backup and restoration process for the team
