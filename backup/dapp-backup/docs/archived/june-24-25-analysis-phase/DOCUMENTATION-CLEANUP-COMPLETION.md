- **Archive index** providing complete reference to historical docs

### **Usability Improvements**
- **Clear entry points** for different user types (users, developers, operators)
- **Quick navigation** section in main README
- **Cross-references** between related documents
- **Practical examples** and code snippets throughout

### **Maintenance System**
- **Quarterly review process** established
- **Clear guidelines** for adding new documentation

## 🔧 What We Kept vs. Eliminated

### **Consolidated (Not Lost)**
- ✅ **Architecture specifications** → `development/architecture.md`
- ✅ **Feature implementations** → `development/features.md`
- ✅ **API references** → `api/reference.md`
- ✅ **Project history** → `development/implementation-history.md`
- ✅ **User guidance** → `user/guide.md`
- ✅ **Deployment procedures** → `deployment/production.md`

### **Archived (Preserved for Reference)**
- 📁 **Phase reports** → Dated archive files
- 📁 **Implementation details** → Archived with full index
- 📁 **Historical decisions** → Available in implementation history
- 📁 **Technical specifications** → Archived with consolidation map

### **Eliminated (Truly Redundant)**
- ❌ **artifacts/old/** directory (53 deprecated files)
- ❌ **Duplicate intel-reports** (12 files → 1 summary)
- ❌ **Redundant phase reports** (consolidated into history)
- ❌ **Obsolete TODO/FIXME docs** (placeholder content)
