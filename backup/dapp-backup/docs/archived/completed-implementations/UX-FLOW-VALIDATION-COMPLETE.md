## üîç Authentication Flow Details

### Step-by-Step User Experience

1. **Initial State**
   - User lands on app
   - Sees login button in top bar
   - Can explore public content
   - AuthGate components show contextual prompts for protected features

2. **Wallet Connection**
   - User clicks "Login" button
   - Wallet selector appears (handled by Solana wallet adapter)
   - User selects preferred wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
   - Wallet extension prompts for connection approval

3. **SIWS Authentication**
   - App generates SIWS message with nonce
   - User signs the message in their wallet
   - Signature verified using Ed25519 cryptography
   - Session created with 24-hour expiration

4. **Role & Token Verification**
   - System checks for on-chain roles (Admin, Analyst, etc.)
   - Verifies NFT/token ownership via Metaplex SDK
   - Roles and features unlocked based on on-chain data

5. **Authenticated Experience**
   - Protected content becomes accessible
   - Feature gates open based on role/token requirements
   - Session auto-refreshes at 75% TTL
   - Audit trail logs all authentication events

### Meaningful Use Cases
