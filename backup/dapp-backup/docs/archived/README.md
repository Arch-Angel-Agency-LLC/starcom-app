## Archive Organization & Earth Alliance Evolution

### 2025-07-01 (Analysis Phase Archive)  
**Directory**: `june-24-25-analysis-phase/`

Major cleanup of analysis and planning phase documentation completed during June 24-25, 2025. These documents served their purpose in identifying and resolving documentation issues, code quality problems, and structural improvements.

**Key Contents**:
- Documentation cleanup analysis and planning documents
- System architecture analysis and reality check documents  
- Code quality analysis (subnet-gateway findings, security gaps)
- Progress and completion reports from the cleanup activities
