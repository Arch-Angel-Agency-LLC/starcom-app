## Archive Organization

Documents are organized by the date they were moved to the archive. All documents in this archive represent completed work or superseded plans.

## Current Active Documentation

The main docs directory now contains only essential, current documentation:

### Essential Active Docs (Remaining in `/docs/`)
- `README.md` - Main documentation index
- `CURRENT-STATE-OVERVIEW.md` - Current project status and architecture
- `CURRENT-STATUS-REPORT.md` - Current development status
- `STORAGE-MANAGEMENT.md` - Storage monitoring and maintenance
- `AUTHENTICATION-TESTING-GUIDE.md` - Current authentication testing
- `CONFIGURATION-GUIDE.md` - Current configuration guidance
- `GLOBE-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` - Current globe integration
- `3D-ASSET-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` - Current 3D asset deployment
- `TESTING-STRATEGY.md` - Current testing strategy

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Reference Legacy Archive
- Historical context for implementation decisions
- Understanding evolution of system architecture
- Reviewing completed implementation approaches
- Audit trail for development progress

### How to Find Information
1. **Check Current Docs First**: Essential information is in the main docs directory
2. **Use Archive Structure**: Documents are date-organized within archives
3. **Search by Topic**: Use the categories above to locate relevant documents
4. **Cross-Reference**: Check archive README files for content maps

## Maintenance

This archive should be reviewed quarterly to:
- Remove truly obsolete documents after sufficient time
- Restore any documents that become relevant to current work
- Maintain organization and indexing
- Update cross-references as needed
