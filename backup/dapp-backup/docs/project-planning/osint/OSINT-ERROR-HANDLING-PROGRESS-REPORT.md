### Technical Details

#### Standardized Error Structure

The new error handling system uses a standardized `ErrorDetail` interface:

```typescript
interface ErrorDetail {
  // Basic error information
  message: string;            // Human-readable error message
  code?: ErrorCode;           // Error code (e.g., NETWORK_DISCONNECTED)
  category?: ErrorCategory;   // Error category (e.g., network, security)
  severity?: ErrorSeverity;   // Error severity (info, warning, error, critical)
  
  // Context information
  operation?: string;         // Operation that failed
  component?: string;         // Component where error occurred
  timestamp: string;          // When the error occurred
  
  // Debugging information
  originalError?: Error;      // Original error object
  stack?: string;             // Stack trace
  
  // Recovery information
  recoverable: boolean;       // Whether error is recoverable
  retryable: boolean;         // Whether operation can be retried
  retryCount?: number;        // Number of retry attempts
  retryAfter?: number;        // Milliseconds to wait before retry
  userActions?: string[];     // Suggested user actions
  
  // Additional data
  context?: Record<string, unknown>; // Additional context
}
```

#### Retry Logic Implementation

The service layer now includes automatic retry with exponential backoff:

```typescript
async function executeWithRetry<T>(
  operation: () => Promise<T>, 
  options: {
    retries?: number;
    baseDelay?: number;
    maxDelay?: number;
    operationName?: string;
  }
): Promise<T> {
  const { 
    retries = 3, 
    baseDelay = 300, 
    maxDelay = 3000,
    operationName = 'unknown'
  } = options;
  
  let lastError: unknown;
  
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < retries + 1; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      lastError = error;
      
      // Don't wait on the last attempt
      if (attempt < retries) {
        // Calculate delay with exponential backoff and jitter
        const delay = Math.min(
          maxDelay,
          baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt) * (0.8 + Math.random() * 0.4)
        );
        
        // Log retry attempt
        console.warn(
          `[Retry] Operation ${operationName} failed, retrying in ${delay.toFixed(0)}ms ` +
          `(attempt ${attempt + 1}/${retries})`
        );
        
        // Wait before retrying
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
      }
    }
  }
  
  // If we get here, all retries failed
  throw lastError;
}
```

#### UI Error Display Enhancements

The UI now provides:

1. **Categorized error display** with visual differentiation based on error type
2. **User action suggestions** with clear next steps
3. **Operation context** showing what operation was in progress when the error occurred
4. **Retry information** indicating retry count and retry availability
5. **Detailed error state** with error codes and severity levels

#### Operation-specific Loading Indicators

The UI now shows loading states for specific operations:

1. **Button-specific loaders** for actions in progress
2. **Form control disable states** during operations
3. **Loading spinners** in relevant UI sections
4. **Contextual loading messages** describing the operation in progress

### Next Steps

1. **Expand Coverage**
   - Apply the same error handling patterns to other OSINT panels and services
   - Implement ErrorBoundary components for critical UI sections
   - Add comprehensive logging for errors in development mode

2. **Add Testing**
   - Create unit tests for error handling utilities
   - Add error scenario tests for services
   - Implement UI tests for error state rendering

3. **Documentation**
   - Document error codes and handling in developer documentation
   - Create user-facing help content for common errors
   - Update component documentation with error state information

4. **Service Enhancements**
   - Improve connection status monitoring with real service connections
   - Add offline mode capabilities with error recovery
   - Implement service degradation detection and warnings

## Summary

The enhanced error handling implementation significantly improves the robustness and user experience of the OSINT Cyber Investigation Suite. By standardizing error types, implementing retry logic, and providing clear user feedback, the system now handles failures gracefully and offers users meaningful ways to recover from errors.

These improvements will be particularly valuable when connecting to real data sources and APIs in the next phase of development, ensuring the system remains stable even when external services experience issues.
