💬 AI CONVERSATION LOG

Analyst: "What patterns do you see in the C2 infrastructure?"

🤖 AI: "I've identified a 94% correlation with previous APT-29 campaigns. 
Key indicators include:
• Infrastructure reuse patterns across 3 prior campaigns
• Specific domain generation algorithm signatures
• Temporal patterns matching known operational cycles
However, I'm flagging 3 anomalies that don't fit the typical pattern. 
Should we investigate these as potential false flags or evolution?"

Analyst: "Focus on the temporal anomalies first."

🤖 AI: "Analyzing temporal patterns... Found significant deviation at day 4 
of campaign. Normal APT-29 operations follow 72-hour cycles, but this 
shows 18-hour acceleration. This could indicate:
1. Operational pressure (67% probability)
2. Different operator (23% probability)  
3. Technical adaptation (10% probability)
Shall I correlate with geopolitical events for context?"
