# SecureChatAdapter Test Cleanup

The SecureChatAdapter test file has duplicate test blocks and leftover code from previous implementations. We need to clean it up.

Current issues:
1. There are two separate `describe('SecureChatAdapter', () => {...})` blocks
2. The file has loose code outside of any test block
3. There are syntax errors in the file due to incomplete removals

## Plan:
1. Create clean mock setup file
2. Fix dependency injection in SecureChatAdapter
3. Keep only the first describe block and fix any interface mismatches
4. Test with test-secure-chat-adapter.sh

## Current status:
- Created setupSecureChatAdapter.ts to mock the service
- Fixed SecureChatAdapter.ts to support dependency injection for testing
- Need to clean up the test file itself
