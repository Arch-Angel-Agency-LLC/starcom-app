🌐 STARCOM DISTRIBUTED TEAM COLLABORATION
=========================================

🎯 HOW YOUR TEAM COLLABORATES ACROSS THE INTERNET:

📡 INFRASTRUCTURE (Already Built-In):
   ✅ Nostr Network: Decentralized messaging relays
   ✅ IPFS Network: Distributed file storage
   ✅ Web3 Identity: Wallet-based authentication
   ✅ No central servers needed!

📋 SETUP FOR EACH TEAM MEMBER:
==============================

1️⃣ GET THE CODE:
   git clone <your-starcom-repo>
   cd starcom-app/dapp
   npm install

2️⃣ START LOCAL INSTANCE:
   npm run dev
   → Opens at http://localhost:5174
   → Each person runs their own local copy

3️⃣ CONNECT WALLET:
   • Install Phantom or Solflare wallet
   • Click "Connect" in the TopBar
   • Your wallet = your secure agent identity

4️⃣ JOIN TEAM CHANNEL:
   • Navigate: Investigation → Team Communication
   • Select same channel name (coordinate this!)
   • Examples: "operation-alpha", "team-charlie", etc.

🚀 COLLABORATION WORKFLOW:
=========================

📨 MESSAGING:
   Agent A (California) types message
   → Sends through Nostr relays
   → Agent B (New York) receives instantly
   → Agent C (Texas) sees it too

📄 INTEL REPORTS:
   Agent submits intel report
   → Stored on IPFS (distributed)
   → Notification sent via Nostr
   → All team members can access

💾 OFFLINE SUPPORT:
   Poor internet? No problem!
   → Messages queue locally
   → Auto-sync when connection returns
   → Nothing gets lost

🔒 SECURITY:
   ✅ Wallet signatures verify identity
   ✅ PQC encryption for sensitive data
   ✅ No single point of failure
   ✅ Censorship resistant

🌍 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:
====================

Team Setup:
• Alice (San Francisco) - Team Lead
• Bob (Miami) - Analyst  
• Carol (Denver) - Field Agent
• David (Boston) - Tech Support

Day 1: Alice creates "operation-starlight" channel
Day 1: Everyone joins same channel name
Day 2: Carol submits field report from Denver
Day 2: Bob analyzes it from Miami
Day 2: David provides tech support from Boston
Day 3: Alice coordinates next steps from SF

All coordination happens through:
• Real-time Nostr messaging
• IPFS file sharing
• Wallet-based identity

🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS:
===================

Message Flow:
Your dApp → Public Nostr Relay → Teammate's dApp

File Flow:
Your dApp → IPFS Network → Global Distribution

Identity:
Your Wallet → Cryptographic Signature → Verified Identity

No Corporate Servers!
No Single Points of Failure!
Works Globally!

⚡ QUICK START CHECKLIST:
========================

□ Each person: git clone + npm install + npm run dev
□ Each person: Connect wallet (same type recommended)
□ Team: Agree on channel name
□ Everyone: Join same channel
□ Start: Send test messages
□ Verify: Everyone sees the messages
□ Begin: Real operations!

🎯 SUCCESS INDICATORS:
====================

✅ Everyone can send/receive messages
✅ Intel reports appear for all team members
✅ Offline members sync when they return
✅ No central coordinator needed
✅ Works from anywhere with internet

That's it! You now have a decentralized, censorship-resistant,
globally-distributed team communication system! 🚀
