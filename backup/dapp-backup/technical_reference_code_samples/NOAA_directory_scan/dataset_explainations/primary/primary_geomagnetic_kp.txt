The JSON file primary_geomagnetic_kp.json appears to be empty ([]), meaning it does not contain any data. However, based on its name, it is likely meant to store Kp index values.

What is the Kp Index?

The Kp index (Planetary K-index) is a global measure of geomagnetic activity, based on magnetometer readings from multiple observatories around the world. It is used to monitor geomagnetic storms and space weather conditions.

What is This Data Used For?
	•	Predicting geomagnetic storms that can affect satellites, GPS, and power grids.
	•	Assessing auroral activity (higher Kp values indicate stronger auroras visible at lower latitudes).
	•	Monitoring solar activity’s impact on Earth’s magnetic field.

Kp Scale Interpretation:

Kp Index	Geomagnetic Activity Level
0-2	Quiet
3	Unsettled
4	Active
5-6	Minor to Moderate Storm
7-9	Strong to Extreme Storm

Since the file is empty, it might indicate:
	1.	No recent Kp data was recorded.
	2.	A failed API request when retrieving data.
	3.	The dataset hasn’t been updated.

Would you like me to check for real-time Kp index values from NOAA?
