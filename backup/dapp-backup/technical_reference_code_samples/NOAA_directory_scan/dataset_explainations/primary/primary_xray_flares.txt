The JSON file primary_xray_flares.json contains solar X-ray flare data from NOAA, specifically from the GOES-16 satellite. This dataset tracks solar flares, which are bursts of high-energy radiation from the Sun that can impact Earth’s ionosphere, communications, and space weather conditions.

Breakdown of Key Fields:
	1.	time_tag – The timestamp (UTC) of the most recent recorded X-ray flare activity.
	2.	satellite – The satellite identifier (GOES-16 in this case).
	3.	current_class – The current X-ray class of the flare, which follows NOAA’s classification:
	•	A-Class (Weakest)
	•	B-Class
	•	C-Class
	•	M-Class (Moderate)
	•	X-Class (Strongest, major solar storms)
	4.	current_ratio – The relative intensity of the ongoing flare compared to the baseline.
	5.	current_int_xrlong – The measured X-ray flux in long-wavelength X-rays.
	6.	begin_time – The timestamp (UTC) when the flare started.
	7.	begin_class – The flare class at the time it began (C2.5 in this case).
	8.	max_time – The timestamp (UTC) when the flare reached its peak intensity.
	9.	max_class – The maximum flare classification during the event (M4.9 in this case).
	10.	max_xrlong – The maximum X-ray flux recorded during the event.
	11.	end_time – The timestamp when the flare ended (Unk means the flare is ongoing).
	12.	max_ratio_time – The time when the maximum intensity ratio occurred.
	13.	max_ratio – The peak relative intensity ratio of the event.

Purpose of This Data:
	•	Monitoring Solar Flares: Tracks real-time flare activity from the Sun.
	•	Predicting Space Weather Disruptions:
	•	Strong M-Class and X-Class flares can disrupt radio communications, GPS signals, and satellite electronics.
	•	They can also enhance auroras and create geomagnetic storms.
	•	Assessing Radiation Hazards: Helps space agencies protect astronauts and satellites from high-energy solar radiation.
	•	Aurora Forecasting: Larger flares correlate with increased auroral activity at high latitudes.

Understanding X-ray Flare Classifications:

X-ray Class	Flux Range (W/m²)	Effect on Earth
A-Class	< 10⁻⁷	Minimal impact
B-Class	10⁻⁷ – 10⁻⁶	Small disturbances
C-Class	10⁻⁶ – 10⁻⁵	Minor radio blackouts
M-Class	10⁻⁵ – 10⁻⁴	Moderate blackouts, GPS errors
X-Class	> 10⁻⁴	Strong blackouts, power grid risks

Current Solar Flare Details in This File:
	•	Ongoing Flare Class: M3.9 (Moderate)
	•	Peak Intensity: M4.9 at 02:13 UTC
	•	Flare Began at: 02:00 UTC (C2.5 class)
	•	Flare is Ongoing (End time unknown)

This suggests a moderate to strong solar flare is currently active, which could impact radio signals, satellites, and possibly Earth’s magnetic field.
