The JSON file secondary_geomagnetic_kp_7d.json contains Kp index data, which measures global geomagnetic activity over the past 7 days. The Kp index is one of the most widely used space weather indicators, helping scientists monitor geomagnetic storms and space weather disturbances.

Breakdown of Key Fields:
	1.	model_prediction_time – The timestamp (UTC) when the measurement was taken.
	2.	k – The Kp index value, which ranges from 0 to 9.

Purpose of This Data:
	•	Monitoring Geomagnetic Storms: The Kp index is used to detect and classify geomagnetic storms caused by solar wind, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and solar flares.
	•	Space Weather Forecasting: Helps predict potential disruptions to satellites, GPS, and power grids.
	•	Aurora Forecasting: Higher Kp values indicate stronger auroras, which can be visible at lower latitudes.
	•	Radiation Hazard Assessment: Space agencies use this to assess risks for astronauts and high-altitude flights.

Understanding the Kp Index:

Kp Value	Geomagnetic Activity	Effects
0-1	Quiet	No impact
2-3	Unsettled	Minor disturbances
4	Active	Weak auroras possible at high latitudes
5 (G1)	Minor Storm	Increased auroras, possible satellite/GPS interference
6 (G2)	Moderate Storm	Strong auroras, power grid fluctuations possible
7 (G3)	Strong Storm	Widespread auroras, GPS errors, satellite issues
8 (G4)	Severe Storm	Major power grid and communication issues
9 (G5)	Extreme Storm	Blackouts, transformer damage, satellite failures

How This Data Is Used:
	•	NOAA, NASA, and Space Weather Agencies use it for storm prediction models.
	•	Power Grid Operators monitor Kp to prevent geomagnetic-induced currents (GICs) from damaging transformers.
	•	Satellite Operators track geomagnetic storms to prevent navigation and communication failures.
	•	Amateur Radio Operators use it to adjust radio frequencies for HF communication.

Current Data Insights:
	•	The Kp values in this dataset mostly fluctuate between 0.667 and 2.667, indicating quiet to mildly unsettled conditions.
	•	If values exceed 5, it signals an ongoing geomagnetic storm.
