*"here's another thought which I'm curious to know what your thoughts about it are.....Apparently that person "Nick" on TikTok, and [[Linda Gulli Killeen]] AKA "Sonshine Joy" are both really religious and have it stated all over their pages.....I wonder if they know each other from church or something?? Because how the FUCK would Steph know what was being said about her if she's locked up in a psych hospital ya know??"*
