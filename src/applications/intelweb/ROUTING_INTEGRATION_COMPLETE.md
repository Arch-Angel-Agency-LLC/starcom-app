# IntelWeb Routing Integration - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Previously
The **IntelWeb button was routing to NodeWebApplication** instead of our new IntelWebApplication. (Legacy id was `nodeweb`.)

## Current State
- Application id has been renamed to `intelweb` (Phase 0 consolidation)
- Legacy `nodeweb` id removed from router & navigation
- `NodeWebApplication` scheduled for archival under `archives/legacy-nodeweb/`

## ✅ Solution Implemented (Historical)
1. Original fix introduced `IntelWebApplicationWrapper` and mapped id `nodeweb` to new component.
2. Consolidation step replaced id with `intelweb` to remove ambiguity.

## Files Updated In Consolidation
- `src/components/Router/EnhancedApplicationRouter.tsx` (id rename)
- `src/components/MainPage/MainBottomBar.tsx` (navigation id rename)
- This document (historical context updated)

## Result
Clicking the IntelWeb button now loads the consolidated IntelWeb interface. No references to `nodeweb` remain in active routing paths.

## Next
Archive legacy NodeWeb assets and implement migration shim for old localStorage keys if present.
