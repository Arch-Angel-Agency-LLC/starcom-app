## 🔧 TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS

### Workflow Engine Capabilities
```typescript
// Execute complex multi-step OSINT workflows
const executionId = await workflowEngine.executeWorkflow(
  'domain-intel-v1',
  { 
    domain: 'target.com',
    includeSubdomains: true,
    maxResults: 100
  }
);

// Monitor execution in real-time
const status = workflowEngine.getExecutionStatus(executionId);
console.log(`Status: ${status.status}, Progress: ${status.metrics.completedTasks}/${status.metrics.totalTasks}`);
```

### Real-Time Monitoring
```typescript
// Track system performance
monitoringService.recordMetric({
  name: 'workflow_execution_duration',
  value: 15000, // 15 seconds
  unit: 'milliseconds',
  category: 'performance'
});

// Get comprehensive health status
const health = monitoringService.getSystemHealth();
console.log(`Overall Status: ${health.overall}`);
```

### Template-Based Investigations
```typescript
// Use pre-built investigation templates
const templates = getAllWorkflowTemplates();
const domainTemplate = getWorkflowTemplate('domain-intel-v1');

// Execute with custom parameters
await workflowEngine.executeWorkflow(
  domainTemplate.definition.id,
  domainTemplate.exampleInputs
);
```
