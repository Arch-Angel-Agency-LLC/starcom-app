# Performance Optimization Manager Migration Notes

## Migration Status: COMPLETED

As of July 7, 2025, the migration from `performanceOptimizationManager` to the new React hooks and `operationTracker` has been completed.

## Changes Made

1. All references to `performanceOptimizationManager` in the codebase have been replaced with appropriate alternatives:
   - For React components: `useQueryCache`, `useVirtualization`, `useLazyLoading`, and `usePerformanceMonitor` hooks
   - For non-React code: `operationTracker` from '../performance/operationTracker'

2. The deprecated `performanceOptimizationManager.ts` file has been kept for backward compatibility but has been clearly marked as deprecated.

3. Enhanced deprecation notices have been added to the main JSDoc and singleton export statement in `performanceOptimizationManager.ts` to direct developers to the new APIs.

4. Added specific guidance for memoization and React performance optimization in the deprecated manager's documentation, pointing developers to use:
   - React.memo for pure components
   - useMemo for expensive calculations
   - useCallback for function props
   - operationTracker for performance monitoring

## Next Steps

1. **Code Cleanup**: In a future release, the deprecated `performanceOptimizationManager.ts` file and any associated test files should be removed entirely.

2. **Performance Verification**: Monitor application performance metrics to ensure the new implementations provide the same or better performance characteristics.

3. **Documentation Updates**: Update any remaining documentation that references the old API.

## Key Migration Points

- Operation tracking is now handled by `operationTracker` 
- Query caching is handled by `useQueryCache` React hook
- Virtualization is handled by `useVirtualization` React hook
- Lazy loading is handled by `useLazyLoading` React hook
- Performance monitoring is handled by `usePerformanceMonitor` React hook

## Issues During Migration

The migration was largely successful, with no major issues encountered. Some test files for the Globe component show errors, but these are unrelated to the performance optimization manager migration.
